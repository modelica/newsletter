The latest version TIL Suite 3.9.0 contains a model for a hydrogen refueling station including a refrigeration cycle for pre-cooling and a vehicle tank. This hydrogen refueling station consists of a medium pressure storage tank with approx. 450 bar, a booster compressor, a high pressure storage tank with approx. 950 bar and control valves.

A nearly empty vehicle tank is filled completely in two stages: first from the medium pressure level and then from the high pressure level up to approx. 700 bar. The hydrogen temperature must not exceed 85°C to ensure the thermal stability of the vehicle‘s tank. The cooling capacity used to pre-cool the hydrogen during refueling depends on the refueling time, the ambient temperature and the initial filling level of the vehicle‘s tank, among other things.

Hydrogen refueling of passenger cars is generally performed according to SAE standard J2601. The TIL Suite can be used to simulate these refueling processes, to investigate any other refueling scenarios or to identify requirements for new hydrogen refueling stations and their subsystems, e.g. for refueling of heavy commercial vehicles. In simulation studies at TLK-Thermo GmbH and the Technische Universität Braunschweig the mentioned application was examined with regard to possible refueling times and energy demands at different ambient temperatures and cooling capacities. With TIL Suite 3.9.0, detailed simulation results of various refueling processes were achieved and optimization potentials identified.
