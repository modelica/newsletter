Due to the COVID-19 situation, the American Modelica Conference 2020 had to be postponed and converted to a virtual event. 
The new dates are September 22-24, 2020, for the main conference, and the free workshops schedule will also be online on the dates 
shortly before and after the conference dates. The format of a virtual conference will allow us to reach a much broader and hopefully 
much more global audience. We have come up with the following format to support a global audience and get as close as possible to a live event: 
  * Registration for participants is very cheap at $25 per person only and open at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2020-tickets-64989712981). Please note that workshop registration is currently closed, but will be reopened soon. 
  * All presentations will be pre-recorded and will be available to registered participants between the 22nd and 24th of September to watch at any time.
  * There will also be a live, virtual Q&A session, as well as live, virtual "Birds-of-a-feather" sessions, starting from 9 am US Mountain time. 
  * You can access the [conference schedule](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2020Americas/program-outline) online.
  * All participants can interact with one another through a conference web-app using the [Whova](https://whova.com/), exchange business 
  cards and discuss Modelica-related topics. 
  * Registration for Gold and Silver sponsors is still available. You can interact with participants through the web-app, which also supports registering leads. 
  * Questions to authors can be submitted through the session Q&A available in the web-app or streaming app, and will be answered by authors even if you cannot listen in to the live stream at US Mountain time. 
  * Authors and presenters will receive instructions and support from a professional videographer to produce high-quality pre-recorded presentations. 
  
We hope that this setup will allow us to attract many more participants than are usuallly able to travel internationally. As common even for the smaller Modelica-conferences, we have a good selection of high-quality papers that makes it worth while your time to attend the conference!
