Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the worldwide Coronavirus epidemic influences also the operation of the Modelica Association:

- The [2nd American Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2020Americas)
  is now organized as an online conference **September 22-24**, 2020. The tickets for online participation are $25 only,
  [registration is open](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2020-tickets-64989712981).
  Note that registrations for the pre-conference workshops are currently closed, but will be reopened next week.
  The conference organizers are still looking for organizations sponsoring the conference.
  The online conference format gives the unique opportunity to attend the conference,
  even if you did not plan to travel to Boulder (U.S.A).

- The [Asian Modelica Conference 2020](https://2020.asian.conference.modelica.org/) 
  has been postponed and will now take place **October 8-9**, 2020, in Tokyo, as a mixed
  standard/online conference. So people, and especially, presenters of papers that are not able
  to travel to the conference location, will have the possibility to join the conference via
  online services.

- The International Modelica Conference that was planned in March 2021 in Link√∂ping, Sweden, will also be
  postponed, most likely to September 2021. It will most likely also be organized as a mixed
  standard/online conference.

Even if an online conference has drawbacks, it gives new opportunites. For example, I am currently
joining a conference that has typically several hundreds of participants. For the online conference
this year about 10000 people have registered, so many people took the chance to join. 

A new major version of the Modelica Standard Library, **MSL version 4.0.0**, was released on June 4, 2020
(see [release notes](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/tag/v4.0.0)).
Many thanks for the extensive and excellent work of the former project leader Thomas Beutlich and the former 
deputy project leader Dietmar Winkler.

The FMI group is working hard on **FMI version 3.0**. Version [3.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard) was 
released on July 29th 2020. 

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities,
please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. October 23, 2020.

Chairman of the Modelica Association
