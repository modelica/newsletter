The first version of the SSP modeling tool **orchideo | easySSP** is now freely available for the community at [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com). 

#### SSP – Much more than an exchange format

The *SSP (System Structure & Parameterization)* standard and tools such as [orchideo | easySSP](https://easy-ssp.com) can fundamentally change and advance the world of simulation. With this in mind, we are working together with the SSP work group on the development of the standard.
Furthermore, our initiative is to build a network of users and collaborators in order to utilize the full potential of SSP – SSP is much more than just an exchange format.
SSP is the foundation and the enabler of a simple, transparent and fast simulation systems development process that promises high quality. From consistent architecture design to efficient collaboration; from the component integration up to the complete model simulation in the target environment.

#### Get started with SSP

The current version of [orchideo | easySSP](https://easy-ssp.com) focuses on the modeling of hierarchical systems and their components, as well as the definitions of their dependencies via connectors and connections. This is a teaser of the coming features that we are consistently developing.

Utilize the benefits of SSP! Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) and start now.
