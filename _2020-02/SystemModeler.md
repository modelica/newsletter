The following new Virtual Labs’ library is now available for download from the [System Modeler library store](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/):

[HighSchoolPhysics](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/high-school-physics/): Developed in collaboration with [Linköping university](https://liu.se/) contains interactive physics labs related to kinematics and dynamics courses.

The labs are developed using Mathematica notebooks with Modelica models running in the background. For more information please read [this blog](https://blog.wolfram.com/2019/10/08/powering-engineering-education-with-wolfram-virtual-labs/).
