The Rotating Machinery library allows you to test novel designs or identify faults in rotating machineries such as turbines, motors and drivelines. Within the library, you'll find fundamental components of a rotating machinery, such as gears, shafts and bearings. These components are designed to be flexible, enabling you to observe deformations and accurately capture real-world responses under different loads.

Rotating Machinery library will be released later this year. [Click here](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries) to go the System Modeler Modelica library store.
