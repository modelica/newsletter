orchideo \| easySSP v1.2.8 is now available with a new documentation area, new integration options and extended support for Simulation Resource Metadata (SRMD).

#### New Documentation

easySSP now includes a new [Documentation area](https://docs.easy-ssp.com/), where you can find help and information to get started with easySSP. 

#### Integration API

easySSP's Import/Export API allows to seamlessly integrate easySSP's editor and simulation capabilities into existing tools and processes. 

Additional, a new Simulation API lets you simulate SSP files with integrated FMI components in the easySSP Cloud, such as different model variants, parameterizations, input stimuli and targets (Windows/Linux 32/64).
All these aspects can be freely combined and the simulations started can be conveniently managed in a dedicated UI. 

You can find more information about the easySSP Integration API in our public [API Documentation](http://easy-ssp.gitlab-ext-pages.exxcellent.de/docs/integration-api/v1/).

#### Extended SRMD and MIC Core Support

easySSP now offers an greatly improved SRMD editor with template and validation support for the new [MIC Core Standard](https://mic-core.github.io/MIC-Core/main/) for efficient exchange of simulation model metadata published by [IRT SystemX](https://www.irt-systemx.fr/en/) and [prostep ivip](https://www.prostep.org/en/).

Furthermore the new release includes many smaller new features and usability improvements such as:

- [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org/) compliant System Structure Description (SSD) file import and export
- Support for placeholder resources in the SSP Traceability process documentation

easySSP is completely based on open standards like FMI, SSP and SSP Traceability. Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) for more information!
