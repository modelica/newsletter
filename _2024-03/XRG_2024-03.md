Our newest product [**SMArtInt+**](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint) enables hybrid physical and data-driven modelling in Modelica in a simple and convenient way. It has been developed and successfully validated in two recently finished research projects (PHyMoS and DIZPROVI). The **Simple Modelica Artificial Intelligence Interface** offers Modelica and Python tools that will help you to easily integrate neural networks of different sources and kinds in your Modelica models. It uses standardized interfaces, models and methods from the open source SMArtInt Library which is available from [Github](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtIInt).

#### Use Case

There are endless applications to this [noble-prize winning approach](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/). For instance, modelling and validation heat transfer or pressure loss is a complex task in technical applications when accuracy needs to be high. In one of our research projects the aim was to replace a physical ClaRa model of a flue-gas heat exchanger with a hybrid version using measurement data from the original plant (kindly provided by [LEAG](https://www.leag.de/en/)). The hybrid model was clearly fitting the heat flow rate much more accurate as the figures reveal in comparison to the physical model.

#### Profits of SMArtInt+

Machine Learning methods offer tremendous potential when data is available. Nevertheless, it still requires experienced users. Our SMArtInt+ tool-box provides you with the following user-friendly features and benefits:

- Support of TensorFLow, TensorFlowLite and ONNX formats
- Feed Forward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (stateful or non-stateful), Neural ODE's plain or for implementing more complex architectures like Generative Models (encoder / decoder) or BNODE
- Extrapolation and low training data density detection and notification to the user (warning and visualization in the Modelica model)
- De-dimensionalization of Neural Network inputs and outputs enabling more general applicability of trained models
- Automated Modelica model creation through Python and Modelica blocks
- Plattform-independent Modelica integration (Multi-Tool-Support, currently Dymola and OpenModelica have been tested)
