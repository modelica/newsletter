![orchideo \| easySSP v1.3.8 is now available with workflows, SSP 2.0 support and enhanced model parameterization](easySSP-logo.png 'orchideo \| easySSP v1.3.8')

The latest easySSP update brings workflows, SSP 2.0 support and enhanced model parameterization:

The new **Workflow functionality** provides step-by-step interactive guidance directly within SSP containers. Workflow widgets support user inputs, metadata mapping, and seamless integration with SSP models and SSP Traceability data. Workflow documentation is automatically generated in Markdown, ensuring compatibility and easy sharing.

**SSP 2.0 (BETA)** support is now available, enabling more flexible model connectors, acausal connections and new FMI 3.0 compliant data types. While SSP 2.0 is still under development, easySSP already allows for importing, editing, and exporting models as SSP 2.0, paving the way for the upcoming standard.

The addition of **Hierarchical Parameterization** simplifies the management of model parameters. Parameters can now be defined globally or customized at component and system levels, providing flexibility while remaining fully SSP-compliant.

**easySSP** is completely based on open standards like SSP, FMI and SSP Traceability. Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) for more information!
