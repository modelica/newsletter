As a long time member of the Modelica community It is my pleasure to announce my newly openend company: Model Based Innovation LLC, based in West Hartford, Connecticut. 

As a founding member of the member of the Modelica Asssociation, and co-founder of Modelon, I have now started a new venture that will again be fully focused on the open standards of the Modelica Association, and combine that in-depth knowledge with process consulting to help companies speed up their journey towards efficient model based design, and model based systems engineering. 

With my unique experience of being from Europe, but US-based, my goal is to introduce the European-based standards and solutions Modelica, FMI, eFMI and SSP to the US market. I will do this as an independent consultant, and also as a partner of the companies from the European Ecosystem of Modelica Association solutions, helping to find the best fit .
