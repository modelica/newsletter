Claytex publishes a [technical blog](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/our-technical-blog/) covering all things Modelica and Dymola.  

**Experiments with causality (Project Hail Mary physics)** 

Modelica does not require causality to be assigned in equations. This means that a Modelica solver, such as Dymola, must be able to solve an equation regardless of which variables are inputs and which are unknowns. To test this in Dymola an example based on flying a spaceship, as is done in the book 'Project Hail Mary', has been created.

**Golf ball rolling out of hole (Part 1)**

This blog article creates a simple model to explore the behaviour of a golf ball rolling out of a hole after it's rolled into the hole.

**Modelling Air-Oil Mixtures in Hydraulic Systems: Understanding Bulk Modulus and the Claytex Fluid Power Approach**

In any dynamic fluid system, modelling the medium is a crucial step for achieving accurate and realistic simulations. For hydraulic system modelling, the fluid’s bulk modulus which represents the resistance of the fluid to compression, significantly affects the system’s behaviour and stiffness. Since fluid in a hydraulic system is most times under extreme pressure for system operation, it is essential to determine the correct bulk modulus and understand the factors influencing its behaviour. Temperature, pressure, and the presence of air are the main factors affecting the bulk modulus. However, in this blog post, we focus on the presence of air in oils, which significantly reduces the fluid’s bulk modulus, and discuss the modelling approach used in the Claytex FluidPower library.
