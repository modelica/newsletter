TIL Suite is suitable for the stationary and transient simulation of all types of thermodynamic systems. Thanks to the fast calculation of thermophysical properties (TILMedia) and many other numerical optimizations, complex thermal systems such as reversible heat pump systems can be dynamically simulated.

In October the **TIL Suite 2024.1** was released and among others, the following new features are included:
- **Time-variable** specification, control or optimization of **geometry variables**, such as a heat exchanger length or diameter, in the TIL base library and Add-On Hydrogen Energy Systems
- Extended and **improved geometry calculation** for plate heat exchangers, e.g. for the specification of an asymmetrical number of channels
- **Multi-port** version of the thermal models for **'heat'-resistances** and **-capacitances** for simple graphical modeling and parameterization, e.g. for discretized applications
- **New calculation model** according to 'Mc Adams' in VLEFluids from TILMedia for **dynamic viscosity in the two-phase region**

The version prior to TIL Suite 2024.1 is 3.16.0. The versioning has been changed to only two numbers with the release year included. It is now standardized in all products of TLK-Thermo. As with the previous versions, it is possible to update your customer models automatically using the included conversion scripts.
