Professor Luigi Vanfretti began using Modelica-based technology in 2011 and he hasn't looked back since. With Modelon’s help, he advanced his power and grid simulations from low level research to technology readiness levels 3 and beyond. 
*“I have the peace of mind to know my Modelica models will withstand the test of time and can be deployed in any environment at a fraction of the price of an enterprise level tool license.”* - Professor Vanfretti
