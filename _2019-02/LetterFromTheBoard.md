Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the first Modelica Design Meeting was organized in Sept 1996 in Lund and one year later, 
the [Modelica language specification, version 1.0](https://www.modelica.org/documents/Modelica1.pdf) was published.
We are very happy that this initial design was largely improved over the years and that the Modelica language
is widely used in industry and academia. On Oct. 1-2, 2019, the **100th Modelica Design Meeting** will take place in Lund.
This event is celebrated by several activities:

- Sept. 30, 2019, 10:30 - 18:30, a (free) Symposium with invited speakers is organized that present 
  future directions
  of system modeling and simulation. For an overview of this event, see [this newsletter article](symposium.html), and
  for more details, see the [Symposium web page](https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/).
 
- Sept. 30, 2019, 19:30 - 22:30, a (free) buffet dinner takes place to relax and further discuss the symposium topics.
  A Modelica History and Celebration Session will take place during the dinner.
 
- Oct. 1-2, 2019, there are Modelica Association meetings in Lund, especially to coordinate the 
  different standards of the Modelica Association:
  
  * Modelica Language (formerly called Modelica Design Meeting).
