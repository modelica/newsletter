Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the first Modelica Design Meeting was organized in Sept 1996 in Lund and one year later, 
the [Modelica language specification, version 1.0](https://www.modelica.org/documents/Modelica1.pdf) was published.
We are very happy that this initial design was largely improved over the years and that the Modelica language
is widely used in industry and academia. On Oct. 1-2, 2019, the **100th Modelica Design Meeting** will take place in Lund.
This event is celebrated by several activities:

- Sept. 30, 2019, 10:30 - 18:30, a (free) Symposium with invited speakers is organized that present 
  future directions
  of system modeling and simulation. For an overview of this event, see [this newsletter article](symposium.html), and
  for more details, see the [Symposium web page](https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/).
 
- Sept. 30, 2019, 19:30 - 22:30, a (free) buffet dinner takes place to relax and further discuss the symposium topics.
  A Modelica History and Celebration Session will take place during the dinner.
 
- Oct. 1-2, 2019, there are Modelica Association meetings in Lund, especially to coordinate the 
  different standards of the Modelica Association:
  
  * Modelica Language (formerly called Modelica Design Meeting).
  
  * FMI (Functional Mock-Up Interface)
  
  * DCP (Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol), including plug-fest for DCP where tools supporting the DCP standard
    are cross-checked with regards to DCP compatibility.
  
  * SSP (System Structure and Parameterization)
  
  For more details see the [agenda and schedule](https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/meetings.html). Feel free to attend, 
  but [registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jubilee-symposium-future-directions-of-system-modeling-and-simulation-registration-63187850562) is required.

The **FMI** group is heavily working on the next version of the FMI standard. In case you are interested about the status, you may have a look at the [FMI 3.0 development version](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0-dev/). The tool support from FMI is still growing. On the [FMI tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) now more than 130 tools are listed.

The **Second American Modelica Conference** will take place March 23-25, 2020 at the University of Colorado (Boulder). The conference is jointly organized by [NAMUG](https://namug.org/) and the Modelica Association. More information will soon be distributed.

The **9th International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Modeling Languages and Tools (EOOLT 2019)** takes place on [November 5 in Berlin](http://eoolt.org/2019/). The submission deadline for paper proposals is August 5, 2019. All accepted papers will be published in the Scopus-indexed [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/)

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities, please follow the 
[submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html). 
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. Nov. 15, 2019.
