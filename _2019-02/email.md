Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the first Modelica Design Meeting was organized in Sept 1996 in Lund and one year later, the [Modelica language specification, version 1.0](https://www.modelica.org/documents/Modelica1.pdf) was published. We are very happy that this initial design was largely improved over the years and that the Modelica language is widely used in industry and academia. On Oct. 1-2, 2019, the **[100th Modelica Design Meeting](https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/)** will take place in Lund. [(...)](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2019-02/index#letter-from-the-board)
  
Furthermore, the Modelica Association plans to establish an **Industrial Advisory Board**. The goal is to get more feedback and input from industry and align standardization activities with their needs. The “entrance barrier” for participation in this board shall be lower than for full membership in the Modelica Association (for example, no Contributor License Agreement (CLA) required, which has been created for contributors to MA standards). Interested company representatives are welcome to join the Kick-off-Meeting on Oct. 1, 2019, 9:00-10:30 (select during event registration) and/or send an email to Modelica board [board@modelica.org](mailto:board@modelica.org).  

The **FMI** group is heavily working on the next version of the FMI standard. In case you are interested about the status, you may have a look at the [FMI 3.0 development version](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0-dev/). The tool support from FMI is still growing. On the [FMI tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) now more than 130 tools are listed.
