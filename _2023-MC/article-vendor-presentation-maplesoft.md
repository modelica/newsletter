Visit the vendor presentation from our **conference sponsor [Maplesoft](https://www.maplesoft.com)** to hear how the Modelica-based commercial tool **MapleSim** has been updated for 2023 with new capabilities to support system-level modeling and simulation alongside powerful analytic capabilities.

[MapleSim](https://www.maplesoft.com/products/maplesim/flexible-modeling-environment/) provides engineers with an easy to use tool for design exploration and simulation, and offer options to connect the model to other product development tools across an existing toolchain.  This session will be an overview of some of the unique features of MapleSim, as well as an update on the latest software enhancements.
