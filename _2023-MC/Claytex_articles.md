**Removing events from models to improve real-time performance**

When running a model as part of Hardware in the Loop (HIL) testing, it is important that the model simulates fast enough so that overruns do not occur. Unfortunately, when events occur this can cause a model to run significantly slower for that simulation time. A workaround is to remove events from the model. This post looks at different ways this can be done.

**Resolving between Multibody Frames**

The vehicle models in our VeSyMA suite of libraries are multibody models, so when using them it is helpful to understand some of the basics of working with 3-dimensional mechanical systems. In a previous blog post we explained about multibody orientations, so in this post we look at how variables in the mechanical systems can be resolved in different multibody frames.

**Claytex Sponsor The 15th International Modelica Conference – 9th to 11th October 2023**

We exhibit and present at the 15th International Modelica Conference, organized by the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate, RWTH Aachen University, in collaboration with the Modelica Association. 

**Paper title:** Race Car Cooling System Model for Real Time use in a Driving Simulator

**Abstract:** Powertrain performance optimization is one of main targets in racecar and road hypercar development. A key activity needed for both endothermal and electric powertrains is the cooling system sizing through simulation to make sure that the temperature limits are not exceeded in the most aggressive conditions minimizing or avoiding power derating. This article describes the implementation of a 1D cooling system simulation model integrated with a vehicle multibody model to be used in real time in the Dallara dynamic driving simulator with human driver. This activity is the result of a collaboration between Dallara which uses the model implemented to develop and optimize the cooling system architecture of its vehicles, and Claytex who develop the libraries used to generate these simulation models. The model has been validated through comparison with real data of an existing vehicle yielding a RMSE of 0.99 °C.
