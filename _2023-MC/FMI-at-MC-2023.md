FMI is one of the hot topics the coming Modelica Conference!

#### FMI Beginners' Tutorial

There will an FMI beginners' tutorial on Oct 9 given by the FMI project on the first day of the conference. 
You can find more information [here](https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=5), where also the material and installation instructions will be provided.

#### Talk on Layerd Standards to FMI

Members of the FMI project will present the concept of layered standards to the FMI standard.

The FMI standard - just like any other standard - faces the challenge of balancing generality with enabling specific use cases. 
Including every domain or use-case specific extension in the core standard would significantly increase its length, making it unreadable and unimplementable. 
To allow for extensions of the core standard for specific use cases, the Modelica Association developed the concept of layered standards, first in the SSP standard and later in FMI.

Layered standards to the FMI Standard can be defined by any organization, not just the FMI project.
But the FMI project itself is currently working on various layered standards

* for XCP support of FMUs [FMI-LS-XCP](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp),
* for the simulation of network communication with FMI [FMI-LS-BUS](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus), and
* for the representation of regular maps with FMI 3.0 arrays and the structuring of parameters [FMI-LS-STRUCT](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct).


#### FMI User Meeting

The FMI user meeting will take place on Oct 10 as a separate [session](https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=22). The FMI Project and other related Modelica Association Projects SSP and eFMI will present their status and outlook. Additionally there will be two “industrial user presentations” and the possibility for questions.


#### FMI Design Meeting on Oct 12th open to the public (on the day after the conference)

If you are interested in a deeper exchange with the FMI project, you are welcomce to join an “extra” FMI design meeting on Oct 12th (day after the conference, planned for 9:30-12:30, optionally discussions can continue after lunch until 15:00) as a guest. There you can  get in contact with the FMI Project members, discuss ideas, provide feedback,  requirements and new use cases for FMI.
