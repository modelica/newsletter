On the Modelica Conference 2023 XRG will be present with a booth, informative vendor session and three scientific talks about machine learning, zero-mass flow analysis and complex energy system modelling. If you haven't registered yet: **Do it now!**

#### Our Booth

Annika Kuhlmann and [Stefan Wischhusen](mailto:wischhusen@xrg-simulation.de?subject=Meeting%20request) are looking forward to meeting you at our booth in the exhibition area. Sneak around for an eye-2-eye conversation at any time.

#### Our Vendor Presentation: Welcome to the world of XRG!

In this presentation given in Room Silver, we will introduce you to our latest advancements and special features in Modelica libraries and tools, showcasing the extremely enhanced capabilities of our [HumanComfort Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/xrg-library/humancomfort), [HVAC Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/index.php/en/products/xrg-library/xrg-hvac-library), [ClaRaPlus Library](https://www.claralib.com/index.php?lang=en) and our very efficient [Score Excel AddIn](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/index.php/en/products/applications/score) enabling simulations for everyone.

Discover how these multi simulation platform solutions empower you to efficiently simulate and model diverse scenarios, optimize thermal behavior, analyze HVAC systems, simulate power plants, and remotely control FMUs or Dymola from the familiar Excel interface.

#### Our Product NEWS
### XRG HumanComfort und FluidDynamics Library

XRG offers two unique Modelica libraries that enable Navier-Stokes-based CFD coarse grid simulations in Dymola and Modelica. Profit from seamless coupling with system models and less computational effort for transient simulations.

Pre-processing and post-processing is provided by our **Score lite** Application which is a complementary feature of [HumanComfort](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/xrg-library/humancomfort) and [FluidDynamics Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/index.php/en/products/xrg-library/fluiddynamics). If you already hold licenses of one or both libraries and do not have Score yet: Get in touch with us and [request](mailto:humancomfort@xrg-simulation.de?subject=Request%20for%20Score%20lite) your FREE license of Score lite today!

### XRG HVAC Library

The newest version 3.0.0 of our [HVAC Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/xrg-library/xrg-hvac-library), offering the fastest HVAC simulations on the market, is now available for 

 - Dymola (Dassault Systèmes)
 - OpenModelica
 - Impact (Modelon)
 
 ![HVAC Library 3.0.0](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/2023-07/HVAC_scope.jpg?itok=g6h3EmDq 'HVAC Library 3.0.0 offers multi-tool support')

The HVAC Library includes components to model conventional energy systems with gas or oil boilers, as well as sustainable, CO2-neutral systems with heat pumps, solar thermal collectors, photovoltaics and storage units. 
By using a pressure-free modelling approach, simulation results can be delivered very fast, even for complex systems. This makes the models ideal for annual simulations and automated optimization techniques.

The new version 3.1.0 of the HVAC Library got a comprehensive update and improvement of many component models which will be presented in the XRG vendor session on Mon., 9th (see above).

### XRG Score Application

[XRG Score](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/applications/score) executes parallel Dymola or FMU simulations, imports **large** Dymola or OpenModelica result files and lets you filter and interpolate them. Our Score Application allows you to define and save all your simulation settings, model parameters and any results you require in a workbook and directly share them with others. You can run, import and report on any number of simulations over one of these workbooks. You can automatically transfer the results in Excel spreadsheet templates along with integrated charts and formulas.

 ![XRG Score Add-in](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/sites/default/files/2018-05/XRG-Grafik-Score-Kompatibilitaet-e-20180514.png 'XRG Score interaction with Excel and Dymola or FMU')

More technical features of Score:
  - **Multi-Threading** (parameter sweeps on multiple CPU cores) of Dymola or FMU simulations
  - **Automatized** simulation process
  - Import, filtering and interpolation of complex result files (Dymola, FMU and OM) in Excel
  - **Easy exchange** of Excel workbooks
  - Template reports
  - Broad support of MS Office versions through COM add-in
  
The new version 1.9 incorporates some interesting features about post-processing of HumanComfort and FluidDynamics CFD results and more. Please attend the XRG vendor session on Mon., 9th (see above).

- Well defined model design principles including level of detail, level of insight, naming conventions, limited inheritance depth, comprehensive documentation, and more
- **Extensive Media Library** – including ORC Media and steel data base
- **Support for AI** (see SMARTIInt Library)
- Validated against literature and measurement data

#### XRG's open-source products

 We have moved all our current open-source products to [Github](https://github.com/xrg-simulation). **You are welcome to start collaborating today!**

  ![Our Open-Source Products on GITHUB](XRGGithub.jpg 'Our Open-Source Products on GITHUB')

**SMARTIInt**<br>
SMARTIInt provides a user-friendly interface between Modelica and data-based AI models. With its first release the SMARTIInt Modelica library provides integration of TensorFlow neural networks (feed forward and recurrent) as Modelica functions. SMARTIInt can be found on [Github](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtIInt). 
We intend to support further data formats and network structures in the future. Community feedback and help are highly welcome!

**ClaRaDelay**<br>
Unlike the Modelica delay operator, ClaRaDelay also supports vectorized delay time inputs. This is especially useful when it comes to convolution integrals or other control applications. See [Github](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/ClaRaDelay) for details.

**ClaRa Library goes GITHUB**<br>
The open-source library ClaRa enables detailed analysis of power plant processes in Modelica and now broadens its scope towards renewable energies. Its official releases are now also available from [Github](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/ClaRa-official). With the newly established [ClaRa Open Development Repository](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/ClaRa-openDevelopment) we encourage the community not only to give feedback but also to participate in ClaRa's development by contributing models. Don't miss our presentation **"Status of the ClaRa Library: Detailed Transient Simulation of Complex Energy Systems"**([Link to session](https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=45)) at the 15th Modelica conference!
