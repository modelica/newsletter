The Rotating Machinery library allows you to test novel designs or identify faults in machinery such as turbines, motors and drivelines. It contains detailed models of bearings, gears, flexible shafts, and discs. By utilizing this library, you can compare different designs to understand their effects, such as vibrations, deflections and contact stresses.

Some of the key features are:
- Quickly configure detailed bearings using readily available catalog data from manufacturers like SKF, NSK, KOYO, TIMKEN, and FAG.
- Quickly configure detailed gears by defining properties like the gear tooth profile, material data and gear dimensions.
- Simulate contact forces between spur gears based on the Hertzian Contact theory.
- Flexible components enabling you to observe deformations.
- Fully compatible with Modelica MultiBody library with the same connectors.
