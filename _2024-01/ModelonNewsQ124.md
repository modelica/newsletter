#### New and Updated Features in Modelon Impact

We’ve been hard at work making significant enhancements to Modelon Impact. Here are a few of the product highlights from the [recent 2024.1 release.](https://help.modelon.com/latest/release_notes/impact_2024_1/)   

##### New Feature: Workspace Sharing
Modelon Impact users on Modelon Managed Cloud can now share their workspace with a simple web link.  Workspaces, along with their corresponding models, projects, libraries, and library dependencies, can now be accessed and copied by another Modelon Impact user. This enables easy transfer of work between colleagues and higher levels of collaboration on the same projects. 

##### Updated Feature: Excel Add-In
We've updated our add-in that connects Microsoft Excel with Modelon Impact for easily configuring and running multiple experiments on a model. Along with usability enhancements, outputs from both steady-state and dynamic simulations can directly populate Microsoft Excel for further data analysis.   

We've made multiple additions and improvements across the platform, including new library content, an improved debugging experience, access to earlier solvers, and more. [Read the full release notes here.](https://help.modelon.com/latest/release_notes/impact_2024_1/)
