At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technologie (KIT) we from the Institute of Control Systems (IRS) developed a lecture that integrates Modelica into the curriculum of master level engineering students.
The lecture is called *Digital Twin Engineering* and aims to teach the design process of Digital Twins.
In the early stages, the students learn about the fundamentals of Digital Twins, i.e. what a Digital Twin is and what they are useful for.
Afterward, they are introduced to the Modelica language using the OpenModelica Connection Editor.
A quarter through the semester, the students are split into groups of three and get to choose a physical System to model in OMEdit.
For the remainder of the semester, some milestones meetings, like a prototype demonstration early in the development process, are held.
Otherwise, the students are left to their own devices and get to implement a library from scratch.
This includes the development of physical components and bidirectional connectors.
At the end of the semester, each group hands in the finished library, which contains examples that represent the chosen physical system in adequate modeling depth.
Because the students can select the system freely, we get some very interesting libraries.
Some examples include a library containing components to model the human respiratory system. 
Another example is a library that aims to model customizable bicycles and riders to analyze the estimated driving range.
At the end of the semester, each group has to present their Modelica library in a 20 minute session.
The group's grade is based on the Implementation of their library, as well as their presentation and a poster they need to design.
This prepares the students for presentations in the industry and in academia.
