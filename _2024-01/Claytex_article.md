Claytex publishes a [technical blog](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/our-technical-blog/) covering all things Modelica and Dymola.  

#### How to work with Modelica Files using an inbuilt Modelica Function (or three!)

Many cases exist where you might wish to automatically generate Modelica files. One example would be to generate variants of a model with permutations. Or perhaps generating data records. These functions surround the creation and customization of Modelica models.

#### The MultiRun tool localized regression testing made simple

With no off-the-shelf tools available, Claytex have developed our own tools for regression testing when building model libraries. One of them, the RegressionTest tool, is designed to be used as an integral element of a library development cycle. The other is the MultiRun tool, which provides a way for the model developer to quickly regression test a smaller batch of experiments in an automated way. This blog post serves as a quick overview of the MultiRun tool.

#### How to Move Dymola to a New PC

You may have been lucky and your IT department wants to update your PC, or you may have been unlucky and your PC has died; either way this means you will need to move Dymola to your new PC. In this blog post I’m going to go through what you’ll need to do to move your Dymola install to a new PC.
