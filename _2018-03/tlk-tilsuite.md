The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations. The current **version 3.6.0** includes new and improved components and system models. Among other things, we would like to draw your attention to the following innovations:
- Adapter-models between TIL & MSL connectors for Gas, Liquid and VLEFluid are now available.
- New Liquid-Bend-HydraulicResistor using pressure loss from MSL Fluid Dissipation.
- Kv-values are available in the Gas-, Liquid- & VLEFluid-Valve beside the effectiveFlowArea.
- Gas-Junction, -Tube and -Volume can be initialized with the relative humidity phiInitial.
