Dear Modelica, FMI, DCP interested,

The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful first
[American Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018Americas),
held in Boston, USA on October 9-10, 2018. The conference
had 2 keynotes, 36 papers, 11 exhibitors and more as 100 attendees.

[The 13th International Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2019)
will take place on **March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg**
Germany. The submission of regular papers was just closed (on Nov. 19) and we received nearly
as much submissions as for the last International Modelica Conference 2017 in Prague, despite the
fact that there had been two Modelica Conferences in 2018 (in Japan and USA).
We expect that the conference in Regensburg will have 400-500 participants.

Note, it is still possible to submit extended abstracts of 1-2 pages for *industrial user presentations* by Jan. 7, 2019.
The abstracts will be reviewed, but no papers will be published in the conference proceedings.
It is also still possible to submit proposals for tutorials, vendor sessions and exhibitions. The
[registration](https://www.easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?a=12889138;conf=modelica2019;welcome=1)
is already open and reduced conference fees are available up to *January 7, 2019*.

A [new version of the Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases)
is under way, but due to some issues found in regression testing, it is expected that this version will be
released end of this year.

A [new maintenance version](https://github.com/modelica-tools/csv-compare/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
for the CSV Compare Tool has recently released for Linux and Windows. The tool allows comparison
of simulation results and is used, for example, in the regression testing for the Modelica Standard Library.
Note, the pre-built binaries of the FMU Compliance Checker are now also
[available at Github](https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker/releases).

MA continues to move its infrastructure to Github.
Therefore, please use the *Issues* at Github in the future to report bugs or suggest improvements:
[Modelica Specification](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/issues),
[Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/issues),
[FMI Standard](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/issues), and
[Modelica Compliance Checker](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica-Compliance/issues).

The FMI Steering Committee has approved a new set of FMI Cross-Check Rules.
Technically, the biggest change is that the rules are stricter about how you need to submit
the files and how the rules are enforced before accepting your commit.
On the organisational site, the FMI group is introducing a *fee* for listing your tool on the site.
*The money raised this way will be used to improve the FMI standard and the cross-check infrastructure.*
The FMI standard is (and will always be) license and royalty free, so neither the entry nor the usage barrier is raised.
The fee for listing a tool at the FMI web page will be 1000.-- Euro per calendar year for tools providing cross-check
data with a green "available" button, otherwise it will be 2000.-- Euro. Open-source tools are continued to be
listed free of charge.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI communities, please follow the
[submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is **Fr. March. 15, 2019**.

(Chairman of the Modelica Association)
