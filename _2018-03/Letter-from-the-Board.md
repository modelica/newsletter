Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful
[first American Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018Americas),
held in Cambridge, MA, USA on October 9-10, 2018. The conference had 2 keynotes, 36 papers, 11 exhibitors and almost 100 attendees. A short report on the conference can be found [here](./AMCONF_Event_report.md).

The [2nd Japanese Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018japan) took place in Tokyo, Japan on May 17-18, 2018.
The Conference Proceedings are currently [available as one pdf-file](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018japan/conference-proceedings/modelica-final-proceedings-2018-Japan.pdf).
In the near future, the proceedings will be published by Link√∂ping University Press.

[The 13th International Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2019)
will take place on **March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg**
Germany. The submission of regular papers was just closed (on Nov. 19) and we received nearly
as much submissions as for the last International Modelica Conference 2017 in Prague, despite the
fact that there had been two Modelica Conferences in 2018.
We expect that the conference in Regensburg will have 400-500 participants.
Note, it is still possible to submit extended abstracts of 1-2 pages for *industrial user presentations by Jan. 7, 2019*.
The abstracts will be reviewed, but no papers will be published in the conference proceedings.
Industrial user presentations are scheduled for the first day of the conference, on March 4, 2019.
It is also still possible to submit proposals for tutorials, vendor sessions and exhibitions. The
[registration](https://www.easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?a=12889138;conf=modelica2019;welcome=1)
is already open and reduced conference fees are available up to *January 7, 2019*.

A [new version of the Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases)
is under way, but due to some issues found in regression testing, it is expected that this version will be
released end of this year.

A [new maintenance version](https://github.com/modelica-tools/csv-compare/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
for the CSV Compare Tool has recently released for Linux and Windows. The tool allows comparison
of simulation results and is used, for example, in the regression testing for the Modelica Standard Library.
Note, the pre-built binaries of the FMU Compliance Checker are now also
[available at GitHub](https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker/releases).

MA continues to move its infrastructure to GitHub.
Therefore, please use the *Issues* at GitHub in the future to report bugs or suggest improvements:
[Modelica Specification](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/issues),
[Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/issues),
[FMI Standard](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/issues), and
[Modelica Compliance Checker](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica-Compliance/issues).

The FMI Steering Committee has approved a new set of FMI Cross-Check Rules
([FMI Cross-Check](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check), 
 [FMI Cross-Check rules](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/FMI-CROSS-CHECK-RULES.md)).
Technically, the biggest change is that the rules are stricter about how files need to be submitted
and how the rules are enforced before accepting commits.
On the organisational site, the FMI group is introducing a *fee* for *listing* tools on the
[FMI tools web site](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/).
*The money raised this way will be used to improve the FMI standard and the cross-check infrastructure.*
The FMI standard is (and will always be) license and royalty free, so neither the entry nor the usage barrier is raised.
Starting in 2019, the fee for listing a tool at the FMI web page will be 1000.-- Euro per calendar year for tools providing cross-check
data with a green "available" button, otherwise it will be 2000.-- Euro. Open-source tools are continued to be
listed free of charge.

We are looking for interested people that are organizing Modelica Conferences in the future:
The International Modelica Conference in *2021 in Europe* and local Modelica Conferences
outside of Europe in *2020*. If you would like to organize such a Modelica Conference, please inspect the
[Modelica Conference series](https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference)
for instructions.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities, please follow the
[submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is **Fr. March. 15, 2019**.

(Chairman of the Modelica Association)
