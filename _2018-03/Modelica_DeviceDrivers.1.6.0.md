The Modelica device drivers library ([MDD](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica_DeviceDrivers)) is a free library for interfacing hardware drivers to Modelica models. Version v1.6.0, released on Oct 6, is a new main release. It is compatible to MLS v3.3r1 (i.e., no Modelica language features of newer MLS v3.4 are used) and is backwards compatible to the previous MDD v1.5.1. With this latest release the library's license was changed to the new Modelica Association license for libraries: The [3-Clause BSD License](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd).

The main enhancement is support for MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol) client communication for IoT  (Internet of Things) messages with following features:
- Wrapper of the Eclipse [Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) MQTT C client v1.3.0
- Support of (secure TLS encrypted) TCP and Websockets
- Support MQTT v3.1, v3.1.1 and v5.0
