The DCP represents the latest addition to the portfolio of Modelica Association Projects. The "Distributed Co-simulation Protocol" is an application layer protocol that allows integration of real-time and non-real-time systems. The DCP was developed in the ITEA3 project [ACOSAR](https://itea3.org/project/acosar.html). The "DCP Specification Version 1.0-Release Candidate 3" is in its last iteration round, and currently the release of version 1.0 is planned for the Modelica Conference 2019, taking place from March 4-6 in Regensburg, Germany.
