In its sixth year after formation, the [Modelica Users' Group Saxony](http://www.modelisax.de/) celebrated its 20th meeting in the office rooms of [ESI ITI](https://www.simulationx.de/) in Dresden, Free State of Saxony, Germany in autumn 2018.

With 3 or 4 meetings each year, this user group's meetings are a valuable and relaxed get-together for exchange of experiences and news in the world of Modelica and Modelica Association Projects. Usually each meeting's agenda lists diverse topics such as presentations of master or PhD theses, reports from participations in conferences or workshops, discussions on recent developments within the Modelica or FMI community or even recommendations of best practices in modelling or simulation. In this way, the group of more than 50 Modelica enthusiasts in Saxony proved to be one of the most active of all the [Modelica User's Groups](https://modelica.org/users-groups) worldwide.

The organizers and members of the Modelica Users' Group Saxony are looking forward to continuing the success of the user group's meetings in the future.
