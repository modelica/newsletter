The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA from **October 9 - 10, 2018**. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica Users’ Group ([NAMUG](http://na.modelica-users.org/)).

Registration is open, with early bird discounts available through August 20th at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447).

This will be the first full Modelica conference to take place in North America, and will meet the high standards established by previous Modelica conferences. As such, this conference will share the latest scientific and industrial progress related to the Modelica modeling language and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI), and will be attended by a community of users, library developers, tool vendors, and researchers.  The call for papers resulted in over 40 submissions, which are currently being reviewed by the Program Committee, and will be presented in two tracks at the conference. The conference will also include an additional track of industrial user-oriented presentations, like those found at typical NAMUG events over the last 5 years, that are not accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts for these presentations will be peer-reviewed by the conference board.

An entertaining social program is also being planned for the conference, with a dinner cruise around the Boston harbor at end of the conference's first day.  This cruise will afford excellent views of local landmarks, including the Seaport District and historic ships in the harbor, and will provide attendees with an opportunity to socialize and unwind in a picturesque setting.

#### Free Workshops: October 8th

Thanks to the generous support from [MERL](http://www.merl.com/) (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories), NAMUG will organize two **free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th** (before the conference). These workshops will take place at the MERL offices in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops, please select “Workshop Ticket” on the Eventbrite event page. There will be a **beginner’s workshop** in the morning, and advanced workshops in the afternoon: one with an introduction to **modeling of thermo-fluid systems** using applications from the Buildings Library and the second on **physiology modeling** using the Physiolibrary. To aid in planning, please register soon for these workshops since these workshops are conditional on interest and participation.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.

*Dr. Michael Tiller* and Associate Professor *Luigi Vanfretti*, PhD, General Chair (Xogeny) and Program Chair (Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute)
