The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations. The current **version 3.5.1** includes new and improved components and system models. Among other things, we would like to draw your attention to the following innovations:
- Two new blocks in Utilitis\Numerics: SmoothSwitch and DiscreteSignalSmoother can be used to get smooth transitions between signals.
- Numerical robustness of almost all valves (Gas, Liquid & VLEFluid) improved.
- Set-point weighting available in PI-Controller, which decouples set-point and feedback acting.
