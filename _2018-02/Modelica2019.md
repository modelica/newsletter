#### Conference Venue
The conference will take place at Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (Eastbavarian Technical University) Regensburg near the center of Regensburg, 
only 30 minutes to walk from the historical centre of Regensburg.    
**Venue Address**: OTH Regensburg    
Seybothstr. 2, 93053 Regensburg, Germany

The **Modelica Conference** is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge 
and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface.
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. 
In addition to paper presentations and poster sessions, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as vendor presentations, and an exhibition. 
The previous Modelica conference in 2017 in Prague, Czech Republic, was attended by more than 400 participants from all over the world, 
and we would like to welcome even more participants to this conference.
