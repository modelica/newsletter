The new **XRG Score** release enables multi-physics simulations by using the „Functional Mock-up Interface“ version 2.0. Score is supplied as an Microsoft Excel Add-in which makes the exchange of simulation data very easy. Simply everyone who has an Excel license can read, change or prepare values for simulation in the same file. This helps to deploy work from Modelica users to other colaborators.

Furthermore, the XRG Score transfers Dymola or OpenModelica results files and lets you filter and interpolate them. Score transfers parameter tables created in Excel to Dymola scripts and lets you start Dymola directly over an interface to run simulations and import the results. Our Score Application allows you to define and save all your simulation settings and any results you require in a workbook. You can run, import and report on any number of simulations over one of these workbooks. You can automatically transfer the results in Excel spreadsheet templates along with integrated charts and formulas.

More technical features of Score:
  - **Multi-Threading** (parameter sweeps on multiple CPU cores)
  - **Automatized** simulation process
  - Import, filtering and interpolation of complex result files (Dymola, FMU and OM) in Excel
  - Template reports
  - Broad support of MS Office versions through COM add-in
