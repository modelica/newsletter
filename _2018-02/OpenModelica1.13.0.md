OpenModelica is the most complete open-source Modelica-based cyber-physical mathematical modeling,
simulation and optimization environment intended for industrial and academic usage.
Its long-term development is supported by a non-profit organization – the Open Source Modelica Consortium [OSMC](https://www.openmodelica.org/)
with many company, institute, and university members.

The current OpenModelica development is focused on OpenModelica v1.13.0, for which a Beta1 release is planned at the end of June, 2018.
Some of the main new items in this release are the following:

- Replaceable library GUI support.
- [OMSimulator v2.0.0](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OMSimulator/html/) – the second release of our efficient FMI Simulation tool including a GUI for FMI Composition and co-simulation, as well as [transmission line modeling](https://www.openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.13.0-dev.beta0/omsimulator.html)
- Improved OpenModelica DAEMode for efficient solution of large Modelica models.
- [Matlab scripting](https://www.openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.13.0-dev.beta0/ommatlab.html) API to OpenModelica.
- [Julia scripting](https://www.openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.13.0-dev.beta0/omjulia.html) API to OpenModelica.
- [OMSysIdent](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OMSimulator/html/) - parameter estimation module for linear and non-linear parametric dynamic models.
- [Interactive simulation](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.13.0-dev.beta0/omedit.html#interactive-simulation) and control of simulations with OPC-UA.
- [PDEModelica1](https://www.openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.13.0-dev.beta0/pdemodelica.html) - experimental support for one-dimensional PDEs in Modelica.
- Analytic directional derivatives for FMI export and efficient calculation of multiple Jacobian columns – giving much faster simulation for some models
- Enhanced OMEdit – including fast multi-file search
