Dear Modelica and FMI interested,

The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful second 
Japanese Modelica Conference, held in Japan on May 2018. As already announced in the last newsletter, *The International Modelica Conference* will take place now every 2 years in March in Europe. The next one will take place in **March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg** Germany. Besides the conference in Japan, this year the first American Modelica
Conference will take place in **Boston, Oct. 9-10, 2018**. 

All MA projects are very active. As an example, a new version of the **Modelica Standard Library**
is on the way and a new MA project will most likely start in the near future:
**DCP - The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol**. This important new standardization activity will strengthen the very successful
[FMI standard](https://fmi-standard.org/) by providing missing functionality for
distributed simulations.
