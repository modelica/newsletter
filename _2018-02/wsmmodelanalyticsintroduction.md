You will learn how to use SystemModeler and the Wolfram Language to:

- Get complete control over simulations, such as being able to programmatically specify initial conditions, parameter values and input signal functions
- Create custom plots of variables, such as 3D plots, animations and sensitivity bands, directly from simulation results
- Programmatically create models, either from physical equations or by connecting and configuring models using scripting
