Interactive simulation and interactive control of simulations is provided in OpenModelica 1.13.0 using
OPC-UA, which is an industry standard for industrial automation.

OPC-UA in OpenModelica:

* Controls simulations in real-time
* Changes inputs and state variables on the fly
* Performs interactive plotting
* More lightweight than controlling FMUs for your own simple applications

There are open source OPC-UA clients available in C++, Python, etc.

The video below shows an early prototype of the interactive plotting.
