FMPy is a free Python library to simulate Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) that...

- supports FMI 1.0 and 2.0
- supports Co-Simulation and Model Exchange
- runs on Windows, Linux and macOS
- has a graphical user interface
- compiles source code FMUs

It's developed at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes and released under the 3-clause BSD license.  

For more information on how to install FMPy and a short tutorial take a look at the [documentation](http://fmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and visit our [project on GitHub](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy).

Changes since the last newsletter:
