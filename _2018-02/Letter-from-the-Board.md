Dear Modelica and FMI interested,

The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful second 
Japanese Modelica Conference, held in Japan on May 2018. The conference 
had 3 keynotes, 37 papers, 10 exhibitors and more as 140 attendees, 
about 25 % from outside of Japan, mainly from Europe and Korea.

As already announced in the last newsletter, *The International Modelica Conference* 
will take place now every 2 years in March in Europe. The next one will take 
place in **March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg** Germany (deadline for paper 
submissions: **Nov. 5, 2018**). We hope many of you will participate. 
More details about the conference are available 
[below](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-02/index#13th-international-modelica-conference-2019).
In the year between International Modelica Conferences, Modelica Conferences shall
be organized on other continents with country specific focus.
Besides the conference in Japan, this year the first American Modelica
Conference will take place in **Boston, Oct. 9-10, 2018**. More details about
this conference are available [below](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-02/index#american-modelica-conference-2018-october-9-10).
If you also would like to organize a Modelica Conference, please inspect the 
[Modelica Conference series](https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference) 
for instructions.

The MA Backoffice, operated by [LTX](http://www.ltx.de/english.html) has 
started its operation in April 2018 and helps the MA board with administrative
tasks (*e.g.* to fulfill the EU GDPR regulations, organize the FMI crosscheck acounts,
create MA stickers, *etc.*). In particular, the backoffice is now also maintaining a 
[Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=backoffice%40modelica.org)
(add to [ics supporting calendar applications](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/backoffice%40modelica.org/public/basic.ics), such as Outlook) 
about MA activities. If you have dates that should be included
(*e.g.* Modelica or FMI web meetings, or the date of a Modelica User Group meeting),
please send an email to [the MA backoffice](mailto:backoffice@modelica.org) with this information.

All MA projects are very active. As an example, a new version of the **Modelica Standard Library**
is on the way. At the end of June, [Beta.3](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/tag/v3.2.3-beta.3) 
was tagged that contains [472](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/download/v3.2.3-beta.3/ResolvedGitHubIssues.pdf) 
resolved issues.

MA is on the way to move nearly all of its infrastructure to Github. In the past, the FMI web page
and svn, as well as the Modelica Standard Library svn and issue  tracker have been moved.
Recently, the move of the FMI cross check results has been finished.
In the near future, all remaining issue trackers will be moved from trac to github.

A new MA project will most likely start in the near future:
**DCP - The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol**.
This important new standardization activity will strengthen the very successful
[FMI standard](https://fmi-standard.org/) by providing missing functionality for
distributed simulations. DCP is a standard that is being developed in the
ITEA project [ACOSAR](https://itea3.org/project/acosar.html).
It is planned to publish the ACOSAR results as the DCP standard via 
the Modelica Association and perform the further development as an MA project.
The MA welcomes the new project leader, Martin Krammer from [V2C2](https://www.v2c2.at/),
and his deputy, Klaus Schuch from [AVL](https://www.avl.com).

If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI communities, please follow the
[submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html). 
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is **Fr. Nov. 16, 2018**.

Martin Otter on July 13, 2018    
(Chairman of the Modelica Association)
