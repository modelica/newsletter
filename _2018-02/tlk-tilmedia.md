The TILMedia Suite provides methods of calculation, which express the thermophysical properties of incompressible liquids, ideal gases and real fluids containing a vapor liquid equilibrium. Among other things, we would like to draw your attention to the following innovations in the current **version 3.5.1**:
- Improved robustness of dew point calculation for Gases.
- Improved extrapolation/robustness of VLEFluid TILMedia mediums.
- Added thermal conductivity model of Tufeu for ammonia.
- Added pseudo pure fluid for air.
- New speed of sound models for VLEFluids (Wood, Henry).
