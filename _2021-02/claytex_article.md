Claytex publishes a [technical blog]( https://www.claytex.com/blog/) covering all things Modelica and Dymola.  

The Analytical Jacobian 

Dymola is a tool built around advanced symbolic manipulation. Many solver algorithms and numerical methods are / can be utilized to solve the models created within Dymola. Many of the algorithms and numerical methods have substantial impact on the accuracy and speed of the resulting simulations. Jacobian matrices play a key part in much of this.

Checking derivatives by using the plotting features

This post looks at a simple way to check that derivatives of a function are correct and in the process explores some of the different plotting features of Dymola. Read the full article [here](https://www.claytex.com/tech-blog/checking-derivatives-by-using-the-plotting-features/)

Dymola Library Concealment â€“ How to, and why?

Dymola and Modelica make the distribution and deployment of simulation models a relatively simple process. There is often some reservation by model developers concerning how much of a model they may want to reveal to the end users. There are various reasons the developer may want to conceal the model content, but it generally revolves around protection of their intellectual property.
