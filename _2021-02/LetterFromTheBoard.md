Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

the [14th International Modelica Conference](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/) is approaching, taking place 
**Mo. Sept. 20 - Fr. Sept. 24, 2021**. It is a **free**, virtual/online event, but you must [register](https://www.trippus.se/web/registration/Registration.aspx?view=registration&idcategory=AB0ILBBscfgVo6ZZ4O5u-Bx5_XkKg9Y5J_hMAXgfFYWRClh6asLWnZ_P6iGC5e3_zu9Z7Hyb5Hv_&ln=eng)
in order to participate. The local organizers are trying to make the conference quite interactive:

- A presentation consists either of an uploaded video or a live talk. In any case, you can raise your hand (click the hand button in zoom), 
  and a moderator moves you to the panel, typically in the last 5 minutes of every presentation slot. The people in the panel can 
  talk to each other, while the rest of the audience is listening, so a discussion with the presenter is possible.

- The breaks will be run using wonder.me - an app where you can move around in a virtual hall and when you come closer to people conversations with them open.

- Gold sponsors have their own virtual booths where you can directly talk to them.

More practical information is available [here](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/practical.html). Besides the scientific presentations,
the tutorials and the vendor presentations, let me highlight:

- Sept. 20, 14:15-15:00 CEST: Keynote 1 from Viral Shah and 
  Chris Rackauckas - *New Horizons in Modeling and Simulation with Julia*.
- Sept. 23, 13:30-17:15 CEST: The [Industrial Usage of FMI and Companion Standards SSP / DCP/ eFMI](fmi_user_meeting.html).
- Sept. 24, 15:40-16:25 CEST: Keynote 2 from Michael Wetter - 
  *How can the Modelica community support the transition to decarbonized, grid-flexible buildings?*

On May 10 and 11, a Modelica Association **Strategy Meeting** took place. As an outcome, the operation of the Modelica Association and the Modelica Association Projects
shall be improved in the future.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities,
please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. December 3, 2021.
