[Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/ ) is proud to announce the 
recent release of Simcenter Webapp Server 2021.1.

As a reminder Simcenter Webapp Server is Siemens solution to create Webapps from simulation 
models in one click without writing a single line of code.
Simcenter Webapp Server is [based](https://www.mendix.com/solutions/simulations-anywhere/) on Siemens-owned [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com) technologies (platform for web-based low code application development).
Simcenter Webapp Server supports natively Simcenter Amesim models as well as third party 
simulation models (e.g. Modelica) through the native support of FMUs.

We can highlight the following new key features:
* A new Simcenter Amesim desktop App to upload your model directly from Simcenter Amesim
* Model consumers can use the unit system they are used to independently of the unit system
 used by the model owner
* Results comparison between several runs in the user-defined results layout
* New widgets to document and fully customize a Webapp without writing a single line of code
* Model consumers can now report any issues with a Webapp directly to the model owner within
the web interface
