We are pleased to announce that Dymola 2022x will be released later this year.

* A new user interface is available for Dymola’s static and dynamic (transient) steady-state solvers, greatly simplifying this task.
Options to sweep parameters, compare solutions and set tolerances are available.

* A new command enables visualization of components discretized in one dimension, for example to show the temperature distribution in a pipe.
The animation slider is used to show the discretization at different times of the simulation.

* Dymola 2022x also supports basic SSP import.
