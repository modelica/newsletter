**orchideo | easySSP** V1.0 now available

#### orchideo | easySSP v1.0

orchideo | easySSP v1.0 is now available. 
Besides the well known easy simulation architecture modeling, orchideo | easySSP now provides cloud-based simulation and support for traceable & credible simulation processes.


#### Cloud-based simulation
orchideo | easySSP now offers cloud-based simulation. 
Simulate your SSP & FMI models with flexible hardware resource options in parallel in the cloud with no load on your computer and compare and export the results in the integrated simulation results view.
This feature is most powerful when using several parameter variants which have to be simulated in parallel.


#### Credible simulation
Simulation needs trust - along the whole process. Therefore orchideo | easySSP now offers support for the so called "Credible Simulation Process" (CSP).
The CSP lets you create a gapless process information chain that helps others trace and therefore trust the simulation process and the simulation results. 
All based on the open STMD format and integrated into SSP. 


More information on how this process is working using tools of different vendors along the simulation process you can find in the the video of the ProSTEP iViP web seminar titled: "Traceable simulation results in heterogenous environment".
