#### American Modelica Conference 2022

The American Modelica Conference 2022 will be a hybrid conference event, the first opportuntity since the 2019 conference to meet your Modelica colleagues in person, and can also be attended remotely via streaming. The conference will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the [Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center](https://davidson-gundy.utdallas.edu/davidson-gundy/spaces/) October 26â€“28, 2022. It is organized by [NAMUG](https://namug.org/), the North American Modelica Users Group in cooperation with the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association). Join us in person in Dallas or from the comfort of your own home. The ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually will be provided for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.

This conference will have one or more conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, as well as a track of industrial user-oriented presentations with peer-reviewed abstracts that do not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. We also plan to introduce a Best Paper award for the first time at this conference. Please see the [Call for Papers](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/call2022.html) for details about paper submissions, as well as the calls for industrial user presentations, tutorials, and vendor presentations. The submission deadlines are as follows:

- June 1, 2022: Submission of extended abstracts for presentation-only contributions and tutorials
