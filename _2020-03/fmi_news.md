#### Updated Cross-Check-Rules

The FMI Steering Committee has passed an [updated version 4.1 on the FMI Cross-Check Rules](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/FMI-CROSS-CHECK-RULES.md), which includes the following changes:

- The FMI Steering Committee revised its decision to introduce fees for listing in the FMI Cross-Check tables: there will be no listing fees for Cross-Check results.
- The FMI Steering Committee decided to reduce the required proof for import results to the self-assessment passed/failed files. This will help reduce the space requirements for the Cross-Check repository without practically reducing the quality of the results. Existing result files for importers will be removed by the project factotum without further notice.

#### Online FMU Checker

There is a prototype of a new online check of FMUs available, see https://fmi-standard.org/fmu-check/.
FMU Check performs a static analysis of the FMU that validates the following aspects:

- validity of the modelDescription.xml w.r.t. the XML schema
- uniqueness and validity of the variable names
- completeness and integrity of the Model Structure
- availability of the required start values
- combinations of causality and variability
- definition of units

It does not check the following aspects:

- validity of the binaries
- validity of the sources
- any non-standard files inside the FMU
- execution of the binaries / simulation of the FMU

This new online FMU Check is based on FMPy, a Python library by Dassault Syst√®mes to validate and simulate FMUs that has a graphical user interface, compiles C code FMUs and generates CMake projects for debugging, see https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy
The online FMU checker complements the checking of FMUs with FMPy or the [FMU Compliance Checker](https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker), a command line tool based on the FMI Library developed by Modelon AB to validate and execute FMUs.
