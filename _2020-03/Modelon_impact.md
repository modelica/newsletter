Modelon Impact is an open, cloud-ready, collaboration-friendly multi-domain modeling platform. It is built on the open standards of Modelica, and unified under a single user interface that teams can use across an entire organization. Every department across an entire organization can collaborate and co-develop from the start, implicitly relying on the same "single-source of truth," and thus reducing miscommunication, last-minute-fixes, and busy work. We are proud to offer this modern user experience and it is simply the beginning – we’re just getting started.
