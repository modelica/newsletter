Besides the TIL release the following models are available in add-on packages:

 - A tumble dryer model including tumble dryer drum and heat pump cycle with e.g. propane.
 - Polynomial compressor models with 10 coefficients according to the EN12900 or AHRI 540 standard.
 - PCM storage with phase-change material to store thermal energy (heat or cold).
 - Air-to-air heat exchangers with a fin and fin geometry and e.g. humid air with condensation.

In the current TIL version 3.9.1 are improvements in compressor, moist air cell and gas valve models among other things. Detailed information are listed in the Release Notes.
