Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

at the Modelica Association Annual Meeting 2020 a new MA board was elected, 
as it is regularily done every two years. The new MA board is the same as in the 
previous two-years period with the following exceptions: 

- The Vice-Chairperson Peter Fritzson resigned. Peter was one of the founders of the 
  Modelica Association and had this position from the beginning. 
  **Martin Sjölund** from Linköping University was elected as new Vice-Chairperson.
  Since many years, Martin has contributed to the design of the Modelica language 
  and the OpenModelica environment.

- The MA project leader Thomas Beutlich and the deputy project leader Dietmar Winkler 
  of the MA project **Modelica Libraries** resigned from their positions after several years
  of extensive work on the Modelica Standard Library leading finally to the new major
  [MSL version 4.0.0](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/tag/v4.0.0). 
  These positions are currently vacant, because no one applied to them.
  Until a new project leader is elected, the MA Chairperson (Martin Otter) is temporarily 
  leading this project. **If you are interested in one of these positions**, please contact
  Martin Otter.
  
The operations of the Modelica Association will most likely grow in 2021. Currently, 
there are plans that two new Modelica Association Projects will be established next year. 
More details will be given, when formal decisions have been made.

Note, you can follow the development of Modelica Association activities on 
[github](https://github.com/modelica),
in particular for the [Modelica language - version 3.5](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification), 
and for [FMI - version 3.0](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard). 

Despite the worldwide Coronavirus pandemic, it was possible to organize
two Modelica Conferences in 2020, both as pure online conferences:

- The American Modelica Conference 2020
  ([Presentations](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2020Americas/program-outline) - click on "Watch video"
   or inspect on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBl0BLUrtXJovo-FdBu7e2A), 
   [Single papers and slides](https://2020.american.conference.modelica.org/proceedings/papers/papers.html),
   [Proceedings at Linköping University Press](https://ep.liu.se/en/conference-issue.aspx?series=ecp&issue=169)), and 

- The Asian Modelica Conference 2020
  ([Proceedings at Linköping University Press](https://ep.liu.se/en/conference-issue.aspx?series=ecp&issue=174)).
  
We are very happy that this worked out quite well, and we will try to improve
upcoming conferences, based on this experience, and hopefully improved
Web-tools.

In 2021, the [International Modelica Conference will take place in Linköping, Sweden
on Sept. 20-22](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/). The conference is planned as a 
hybrid event - so both presenters as well as participants can either join physically, or remotely. Depending on the situation of the
Coronavirus pandemic, the conference might also be changed to a pure online conference, if
this is necessary. Note, the [call-for-papers page](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/call2021.html) is open and you are encouraged to
submit **full scientific papers** and/or **extended abstracts for industrial user presentations**.
Final deadline for the submissions is **April 26, 2021**.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities,
please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. April 16, 2021.

Martin Otter on December 14, 2020

Chairperson of the Modelica Association
