The **American Modelica Conference 2020** was held in a virtual format from September 22-24, 2020 and was a distinct success as the first virtual Modelica conference.  Twenty two papers and fifteen user presentations were delivered at the conference on a variety of theoretical and applied topics, ranging from the Modelica language and tools to mechanical, power, thermofluid, and aerospace applications.  Mark Jennings from Ford and Chris Gearhart from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided keynote addresses related to model-based development for automotive applications, and the virtual format also provided a venue to hold new "Birds-of-a-feather" sessions in which the conference attendees could participate in roundtable discussions about a variety of forward-looking topics relating to the Modelica language and FMI.  Six free online workshops on a variety of subjects related to Modelica were also provided on dates either immediately before or after the conference, and were uniformly well-attended. 

Perhaps most significantly, the new virtual format provided a new means for the conference to connect with attendees across the globe.  While the majority of the 231 attendees were from the United States and Canada, many attendees from Sweden, Germany, and the UK, among other countries, also participated in the conference.  This global reach benefited all of the attendees and the discussion at the sessions due to the wider variety of perspectives and experiences that could be shared.  In addition, the collection of recorded materials for the virtual conference also made it possible to archive these presentations for the future, and all of the talks and presentations are now available on the North America Modelica Users' Group [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBl0BLUrtXJovo-FdBu7e2A), while the proceedings and presentation files are also available on the [persistent event site](https://2020.american.conference.modelica.org/proceedings/papers/papers.html) from the link at modelica.org.

We are grateful for your participation in the conference, and look forward to seeing you at the next conference in 2022!

- Chris Laughman, on behalf of the board of the North America Modelica Users' Group
