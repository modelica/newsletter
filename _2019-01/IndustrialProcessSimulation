A new library focusing on industrial process simulation will be released for Dymola 2020. Developed by the Swedish company Optimation AB, the library offers models commonly used to create a virtual representation of processes for paper and pulp, as well as steam networks. The library has been used for several years in heavy industrial applications, opening possibilities for significant cost reductions:

-	Correct design of new plants and upgrades of existing ones.
-	Controller tuning and optimization before plant is even started.
-	Reduced commissioning time and improved quality from get-go.
-	Operator training capturing correct plant dynamics using a virtual twin.
