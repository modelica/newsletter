#### Conference Venue
The conference took place at Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (Eastbavarian Technical University) Regensburg near the center of Regensburg, 
only 30 minutes to walk from the historical centre of Regensburg.    
**Venue Address**: OTH Regensburg    
Seybothstr. 2, 93053 Regensburg, Germany

#### Welcome
The **Modelica Conference** is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge 
and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface.
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. 
In addition to paper presentations and poster sessions, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as vendor presentations, and an exhibition. 

Starting with this conference, you will notice some changes: 

First, we are going to organize the International Modelica Conference every two years in spring. 
In the years between International Modelica Conferences, Modelica Conferences are organized on other continents with country specific focus.

Second, additional to the tutorials and vendor presentations on the first day of the conference, 
we are going to have Industrial User Presentations related to the Modelica Association Projects. 
These presentations are not included in the proceedings, but they should provide a nucleus for discussions and broadening the users groups.
