Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

The Modelica Association is expanding its standardization portfolio.  As of March 2019, the first versions of two new standards have been released:

*  The [System Structure and Paramerization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org) standard describes in a logical way (using xml-files and other information in a zip-file container) how model components are connected and possibly (hierarchically) composed into composite components, as well as how model parameterization data is stored and exchanged between them. For example, this can then be used to define the hierarchical connection and parameterization of a set of connected [Functional Mock-up Unit (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org) components.

*  The [Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org) standard is an application layer protocol that allows integration of real-time and non-real-time systems. It enables exchange of simulation related configuration information and data by use of an underlying transport protocol (such as UDP, TCP, or CAN) with no overhead during run time. For more information, check out the [release announcement in this newsletter](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2019-01/index#dcp-version-1-0-released-at-13th-modelica-conference-2019). 

The new version 3.2.3 of the Modelica Standard Library was released at the end of January 2019, containing more as **100 new model components** *[continue reading ...](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2019-01/index#letter-from-the-board)*
