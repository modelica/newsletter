What do Schneider Electric, thyssenkrupp Elevators, and Mabe all have in common? Their engineering teams are designing better products, faster, through their use of Altair Activate™ as their open platform for multi-disciplinary system simulation.  

Activate provides built-in access to specialized Modelica libraries facilitating the 1D physical modeling of mechanical, thermal, electrical, hydraulic, and magnetic subsystems. Hybrid **1D modeling** can be achieved by using any combination of models defined with a physical-based approach, with a signal-based approach, and/or with SPICE.  

This approach also enables equation-based **0D modeling** directly, by leveraging the OpenMatrix Language (OML). And it enables sophisticated **0D/1D/3D combined modeling** by easily coupling and co-simulating with 3D models – obtained from Altair tools directly (e.g., for electromagnetics or mechanics) and/or from third-party tools through the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard. Linearization and optimization are also available in the same modeling environment.
