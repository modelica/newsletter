At the recent Modelica Conference, Dassault Systèmes revealed the upcoming Dymola 2020 release. Key improvements include:

-	Running simulations on multiple CPU cores, which is automatically applied to parameter sweeps. In addition, it is possible to set an option to only write variables to the result file at stop time, significantly reducing system overhead.
-	Improved steady state initialization and advanced options for controlling start guess values. These improvements improves initialization of large systems.
-	The model diagram layer can be used to directly select plot variables in components or in connections.
-	New commercial library for industrial process simulation, developed by Optimation AB.
-	Uses Modelica Standard Library 3.2.3.
