Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the Modelica Association is expanding its standardization portfolio: Beginning of March, two new standards had been released in their first version:

*  The [System Structure and Paramerization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org) standard describes in a logical way with xml-files and other information in a zip-file container how model components are connected and possibly (hierarchically) composed into composite components, as well as how model parameterization data is stored and exchanged between them. This allows for example to define the hierarchical connection and parameterization of a set of connected [Functional Mock-up Unit (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org) components.

*  The [Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org) standard is an application layer protocol that allows integration of real-time and non-real-time systems. It enables exchange of simulation related configuration information and data by use of an underlying transport protocol (such as UDP, TCP, or CAN) with no overhead during run time. For more information, check out the release announcement in this newsletter. 

The new version 3.2.3 of the Modelica Standard Library was released end of January 2019, containing more as **100 new model components** and fixing about [550 reported issues](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelica/Modelica/maint/3.2.3/Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Version-3.2.3/ResolvedGitHubIssues.html). Furthermore, the license of the library has been changed to the [BSD 3-clause license](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd), in order to simplify the usage of the library. For more detailed information, see the [release notes](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/modelica/Modelica/blob/maint/3.2.3/Modelica/Resources/ReleaseNotes/Modelica.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes.Version_3_2_3.html).
Unfortuntely, some minor regressions with regards to wrong *obsolete messages* had been detected after this release. For this reason a second build of version 3.2.3 was released on March 20, to fix these minor inconveniences.

The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful 13th International Modelica Conference, held in Regensburg, Germany on March 4-6, 2019. The conference had 89 papers, 2 sessions with industrial user presentations, 17 exhibitors and about 320 attendees. As always, the open access conference proceedings are available from [Linköping University Electronic Press](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/contents.asp?issue=157). For more information, see article [**below ???**].

The next International Modelica Conference will take place in two years, most likely in Linköping, Sweden. Next year local Modelica Conferences shall take place outside of Europe. If you would like to organize such a Modelica Conference, please inspect the [Modelica Conference series](https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference) for instructions. Interest has been shown to organize local conferences in 2020 in China, Japan and North-America.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities, please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html). The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. July 12, 2019.
