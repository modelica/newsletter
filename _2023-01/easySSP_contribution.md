#### Easy FMI Component Implementation and SSP Integration

easySSP now offers the ability to export FMI component hulls for your SSP System Structures. These component hulls contain all relevant interface information and then can be imported to any FMI compliant modeling tool and act as a starting point for implementation.

Moreover a new navigation header facilitates navigating the model hierarchy, when integrating existing SSP files into a SSP model.

#### Extended SSP Traceability Support

orchideo | easySSP let's you document simulation processes based on the upcoming SSP Traceability Layered Standard (release planned end of Q2/2023) and share this information as part of your SSP files. The new version adds support for the Simulation based Decision Process which fills the gap between the higher-level Product Development Process and concrete Credible Simulation Processes. All SSP Traceability documentation capabilities are offered in a brand new Process Edition of easySSP.



easySSP is completely based on open standards like FMI, SSP and SSP Traceability. Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) for more information!
