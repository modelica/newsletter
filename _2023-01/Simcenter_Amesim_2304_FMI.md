## Introducing 3.0 FMUs for co-simulation
With Simcenter Amesim 2304, users will be able to export their models as 3.0 FMUs for co-simulation. 
As before, in addition to native Simcenter Amesim components, models can be hybridized with Modelica blocks, pretrained neural networks, Statecharts or previously imported Simulink models. 
The following 3.0 specific features will be supported:
* [“FMI terminals”](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmiTerminalsAndIcons ), with the following [example](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2021-03/index#fmi-physical-terminals-between-simcenter-amesim-and-simcenter-flomaster ) of concrete application.
* [“Build configurations”](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#BuildConfiguration ), to automate the handling of the FMUs specifically generated for the real-time targets supported by Simcenter Amesim. 

All capabilities that were previously supported by 2.0 FMUs will still be available with 3.0 FMUs, notably the recently introduced Windows to Linux cross-compilation, as already presented [here](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2022-03/amesim_details.html ).

Stay tuned!
