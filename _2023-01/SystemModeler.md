![Alt text](SystemModeler_Aircraft.png 'Aircraft library')

The library allows you to model an aircraft design and simulate its flight through air for a given flight mission. You can test your design for its flight mechanics, controllability and performance (when it comes to fuel efficiency and maneuverability).

Some of the key features are:
- Built-in weight estimation method to set up new aircraft models from a small set of parameters
- Numerous example models that show the wide variety of scenarios that can be modeled with the library, such as aircraft failures, electric aircraft performance and launch of a towed glider
- Quickly configurable aircraft components
