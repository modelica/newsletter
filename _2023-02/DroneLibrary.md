Based on research [1, 2] responding to the growing need of simulation-based studies in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) electric aircraft for Urban Air Mobility (UAM), <code>the DroneLibrary</code>, aggregates the developer's previous efforts in the area providing multi-domain models to represent each sub-system of a quadcopter.

This library contains examples of the quadcopter model at multiple levels of detail under different operating conditions. The component models are developed in a manner to easily replace them for different simulation applications, creating replaceable models that are easy to maintain with broad application scope.

Some of the key features are:
- Built-in weight estimation method to set up new aircraft models from a small set of parameters
- Numerous example models that show the wide variety of scenarios that can be modeled with the library, such as aircraft failures, electric aircraft performance and launch of a towed glider
- Quickly configurable aircraft components
