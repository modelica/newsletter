The Rotating Machinery library offers the capability to simulate and analyze a wide range of machinery types, including motors, generators, pumps, fans, and turbines. Within the library, you'll find fundamental components of rotating machinery, such as gears, shafts, and bearings. These components are designed to be flexible, enabling you to observe deformations and accurately capture real-world responses under different loads. By utilizing this library, you can explore and compare different designs to understand their effects, such as vibrations, deflections, and contact stresses, among other things.
