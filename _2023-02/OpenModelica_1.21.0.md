Version 1.21.0 was subsequently released on 18/04/2023, with the goal of getting the release schedule back to the originally planned two yearly releases, one in early spring (shortly after the OpenModelica Workshop) and one in autumn. 

Version 1.21.0 does not contain major new features, but rather a number of incremental improvements and bugfixes that substantially improved the software quality. It also allowed to turn on the new instance-based API that allows OMEdit to use the new frontend to get updated and correct information for rendering features such as conditional connectors, parameter-depending dialog settings, parameter setting in replaceable classes, etc. This feature was already usable in 1.21.0, but has been substantially improved in the next two months, and is expected to become the default choice for the forthcoming 1.22.0 release, which is planned for September 2023.

Version 1.22.0 will therefore supply a much improved end-user experience with the OMEdit GUI. Further developments are planned within the scope of the new RTE DFD, and should lead to the possibility of releasing version 2.0.0 in 2024.
