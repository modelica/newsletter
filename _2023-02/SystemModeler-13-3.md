The new version comes with features that will accelerate your model development workflows. Some of the key features are:
- *Distribute Libraries*: Ensure smooth installation of your libraries including handling of licenses, assets and dependencies.
- *Interact with Real-Time Simulations*: Manipulate parameters and inputs to see their effects on the simulation in real time.
- *Expanded Simulation Analysis*: Analyze model results by plotting any expression of model variables. Store your expressions and FFTs as model plots for reuse later.
- *Expanded System Models in the Cloud*: Add time series, interpolation curves and noise generators to your models in the Wolfram Cloud.
- *Automatically Calibrate Model Parameters*: Automatically calibrate model parameters using measured data in Wolfram Language.
- *Build & Simulate Concurrently*: Continue working on models and experiments even while validating, building and simulating models.
- *Native Computation Support for macOS ARM Platform*: 30 to 50% reduction in build and simulation time on Apple Silicon/macOS ARM platform.
