The Model Editor in easySSP has seen significant updates for improved user experience. The Parameter Settings interface has been reworked for ease of use and efficiency, providing a more straightforward approach to parameter management.

Furthermore, the Model Editor now includes a new suggestion feature. As users build their models, easySSP intelligently proposes potential connectors and parameters based on the current model state for a  more effective and faster system architecture development. 

#### Simulation Check and Windows FMI Support
We are pleased to announce that easySSP's Cloud Simulation now supports Windows FMI components in addition to Linux and Source Code FMUs. A new pre-simulation check examines your system prior to simulation, ensuring that all requirements for a successful simulation are met.

easySSP is completely based on open standards like FMI, SSP and SSP Traceability. Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) for more information!
