Claytex publishes a [technical blog](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/our-technical-blog/) covering all things Modelica and Dymola.  


#### Use of the Model Management Library

With the installation of Dymola there is the Model Management library, which allows users to be able to gain data about models and even create and modify models. This can be a very powerful and useful tool, if used correctly. This post will go through a couple of examples and a favorite use of the library.

#### Using physical connectors with an FMU**

This article has a look at how to interface with FMU blocks that make use of physical connectors, using a simple electrical circuit that is split into two FMUs that interface with electrical connectors.

#### Back to the Future Flying DeLorean**

We are always looking for interesting combinations of libraries and good demonstrations of novel systems. We have many useful examples within our libraries demonstrating that, such as the use of the hydrogen library with VeSyMA or lots of different interactions to EPTL or HVAC. But sometimes we like to see what can be done thatâ€™s slightly outside the realm of normal applications.

#### Energy Systems Catapult has partnered with Claytex**

Energy Systems Catapult has partnered with Claytex to dramatically shorten the time it takes to run their Home Energy Dynamics (HED) toolkit. New simulations can simulate decarbonisation pathways for domestic buildings, enabling engineers, policymakers, and housing providers to identify the most cost-effective energy-saving actions.
