A new project proposal called **PDE** (partial differential equations) **for Systems** was initiated at the Modelica Design Meeting on March 20, 2018. It addresses the utilization of reduced order models originating from semi-discretized PDE (such as finite difference/element/volume models) from various physical domains  in system simulations in a standardized, tool-independent way. This includes the definition of non-proprietary standard formats to export data from associated tools but also aims to specify a standardized, extended Functional Mock-up Interface (xFMI) component as shown in the workflow instance below. The goal is to organize model exchange and co-simulation of reduced order PDE-models in system simulation and represent cyber-physical systems with relevant distributed properties this way.

The project is supposed to be driven by a collection of use cases which in particular demonstrate the added value of such a standardized interface component and attract industry and commercial PDE-tool vendors.  Everyone who feels appealed by the project idea is strongly requested to submit use case candidates similar to the use case [Health Monitoring of Composite](https://github.com/modelica/pde-for-systems/blob/master/use-cases/healt-monitoring-of-composite.md) to the [repository](https://github.com/modelica/pde-for-systems/tree/master/use-cases), preferably by June 1, 2018.
