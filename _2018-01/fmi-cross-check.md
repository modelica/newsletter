title: Updated FMI Cross Check Process

The FMI project collects and publishes so-called "cross check" data.  As part of this process, each vendor
publishes data about their FMI compliant tools along with FMUs exported from those tools.  This allows other
vendors to test those FMUs by importing them.  In this way, the FMI vendors work together to detect and
address any non-compliant implementations to improve the overall quality of FMI support.

This process used to involve one very large SVN repository where *all* vendors published not only their
tool data and FMUs but the results of their attempts to import other vendor's FMUs.  Needless to say, with all
the large binary files and data files associated with this compliance checking process, the repository
got to be very large.  Furthermore, the Modelica Association had to manage users, permissions, disk
space, *etc.* for this effort.

In an attempt to streamline the process, it was decided to give every vendor their own repository.  In
these repositories, vendors compile data about themselves, their tools, sample FMUs and results of 
importing FMUs from other tools.  In this way, each vendor repository is a more manageable size and since
each vendor is managing the repository themselves, the Modelica Association doesn't need to get involved
in the management of users, permissions, *etc.*.

To facilitate this process, the Modelica Association established the [`fmi-crosscheck` organization](https://github.com/fmi-crosscheck)
on GitHub.  Each vendors existing FMI data was broken out into
individual vendor-specific repositories under this umbrella organization.  Furthermore, these repositories
use a technology called [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) to signal when they have
been updated.  **Using these webhooks, the entire process of generating the FMI web site has been automated**.
Now, when any vendor pushes changes to their repository, a complete rebuild of the FMI web site is
triggered using the very latest vendor data.  As a result, the data shown on the FMI web site is always
the very latest compliance data.

But there were changes beyond simply creating vendor specific repositories.  The scripts that process
the data were completely rewritten.  While the previous pages on the FMI web site were static
HTML pages generated while processing the cross check data, the new process involves compiling all
the cross check data into a machine readable form and then rendering it *dynamically* on the web site.
This allows visitors to the site to search and filter the FMI compliance data interactively.  Instead of
long tables and horizontal scrollbars, the new dynamic visualization encourages users to search,
filter and zoom to explore the data which generally fits on a single page.  Users can even bookmark
specific search, filter and selection settings and/or email their results to others as a single URL.

A preview of
the new dynamic web site can be found at [https://preview.fmi-standard.org](https://preview.fmi-standard.org/tools/).
If you find any issues, please report them in the [`fmi-crosscheck-tools` issue tracker](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-crosscheck-tools/issues).

All source code associated with the new FMI cross check process can be found in the [`fmi-crosscheck-tools` repository](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-crosscheck-tools).  This includes the scripts that process the data,
the code that is used to dynamically visualize the data as well as the source code for the build server that
handles webhook notifications and pushes out new published versions of the FMI web site.  If you are interested
in improving the cross check process, we welcome contributions via pull requests for the tools in that repository.

Note, if you are a vendor and you have not yet taken ownership of your new repository, please [contact me](mailto:michael.tiller@gmail.com) so you can be added as an admin to your repository.

With the new infrastructure working, the FMI Steering Committee will now update the FMI Cross-Check Rules and then implement those new rules in the new infrastructure during the next few months.
