DaVE is TLK's software tool to visualize and analyze transient **measurement** and **simulation** data. Its greatest potential lies in the illustration of thermal systems. The main functions of DaVE are:
- Opening different data file formats like Dymola result files, csv and FMUs.
- Exporting data e.g. via your own Python script or directly to csv and pdf.
- Simulating online with TISC, CAN, HiL or offline with FMUs.
- Visualizing data using vector-line plots, thermal state charts (optional module) and many other instruments.

The latest version 1.7.0 contains many new features to make simulation and its post-processing a lot easier and more efficient. One of those improvements is the optional **P&I Flow Diagram** module. This tool allows you to setup a visual model of your system by the use of pre-existing or self-made icons (nodes). You can connect your simulation or measurement data to the P&I Flow Diagram and easily monitor your systemâ€™s behavior.

**The latest version 1.7.0** of DaVE contains the following improvements and features:
- Improved **simulation speed and handling of FMUs** within DaVE.
- New **Tabular Data Connector** to implement data via copy and paste.
- Export your data with your own **Python script** and to **PowerPoint** at the push of a button.
- Improved features for the optional **State Chart module**.
- Many changes improving overall usability.
