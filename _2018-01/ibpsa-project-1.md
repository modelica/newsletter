During the meeting, work was prioritized for work packages ranging
from 
* a Modelica library for design and operation, e.g., the [Modelica IBPSA Library](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa),
* a Modelica library and an FMI-based platform to compare the performance of Model Predictive Control algorithms for buildings called BOPTEST,
* data representation and mapping tools for urban energy simulation workflows,
* a tool chain for Building Information Modeling (BIM) to Modelica translation,
* applications that demonstrate the developed technologies, and
* a validation test procedure called DESTEST for the validation of district energy models.

The next meeting will be in fall in Paris, organized by Engie.
