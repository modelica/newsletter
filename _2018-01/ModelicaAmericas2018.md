The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA
from **October 9 - 10, 2018**. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica
Users' Group (NAMUG).

Registration is already open with early bird discounts available until August 20th at
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447)

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to
share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to the Modelica
modeling language and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). The program will cover modeling of complex
physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial
applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. This conference
is co-organized by the North American Modelica Users' Group (NAMUG) and the Modelica Association. 

This conference will feature one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as
you would find at any Modelica conference.  In addition, it will also have one track of industrial,
user-oriented presentations like those found at typical NAMUG events over the last 5 years.  These presentations
do not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts for the presentations will also
be peer-reviewed by the conference board. 

#### Free Workshops October 8th

Thanks to the generous support from MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab), NAMUG
will organize two **free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th** (before the conference).  These workshops
will take place at the MERL offices in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops,
please select "Workshop Ticket" on the
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447) event page.
There will be a beginner’s workshop in the morning, and an advanced workshop with an introduction to
modeling of thermo-fluid systems using applications from the Buildings Library in the afternoon. To aid in planning,
**please register soon for these workshops** since these workshops are conditional on interest and participation.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.
