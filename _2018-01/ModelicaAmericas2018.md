The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA from **October 9 - 10, 2018**. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica User Group NAMUG.

Registration is already open with early bird discounts available until August 20th at [Eventbrite] (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447)

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to share their knowledge and 
learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). 
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. This conference is co-organized by NAMUG, the North American Modelica Users' Group, and the Modelica Association. 

This conference will have one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, but it will, in addition, have one track of industrial user-oriented presentations as user meetings by NAMUG have had for the last 5 years, that does not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts of the presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board. 

The North American Modelica Users' Group, NAMUG, with generous support from MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab) will organize two **free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th** before the conference at the offices of MERL in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops, please select "Workshop Ticket" on the [Eventbrite]: (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447) site of the conference. There will be a beginner’s workshop in the morning, and an advanced workshop with an introduction into modeling of thermo-fluid systems using applications from the Buildings Library in the afternoon. To aid in planning, please register soon for these workshops

We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.
