The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations. The current **version 3.5.0** includes numerous new and improved components and system models. Among other things, we would like to draw your attention to the following innovations:
- Using the gas components, air pathways and systems can be simulated with ideal gases and mixtures, taking **condensation and ice formation** into account.
- The optimization of the VLE fluid components (vapor-liquid-equilibrium) enables more robust simulations of **refrigerant circuits, heat pumps** or other systems with working fluids.
- With the aid of new and optimized liquid components (hydraulic inductor and compensation tanks), **cooling circuits** and **hydraulic systems** can be calculated much faster and more stable.
- Completely revised and clearly extended documentation.
