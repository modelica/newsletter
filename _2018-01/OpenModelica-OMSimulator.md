OMSimulator is a rather new tool in the OpenModelica tool suite and provides a co-simulation and simulation environment for FMUs. The OMSimulator 2.0 release will be part of OpenModelica 1.13.0 and supports both ordinary signal connections and TLM (transmission line modeling) connections.

The following are highlights of OMSimulator 2.0:

* Efficient simulation of composite models based on model exchange and co-simulation FMUs
* 3D visualization of connected mechanical model components which can be FMUs, Modelica models, or co-simulated components accessed via wrappers in ADAMS, Simulink, Beast, or Modelica
* Graphical composition of FMUs and visualization of simulation results
* Scripting interface
* Distributed simulations utilizing TLM master algorithm
* Increased numerical stability during co-simulation in various applications due to TLM connectors
* SSP (System Structure and Parameterization) support for composite models
