Dear Modelica and FMI interested,

the Modelica Association (MA) is restarting its newsletter.
We are happy that Filip Ježek - one of the organizers of the Modelica'2017 conference in Prague -
will be the editor and organizer of the newsletters. The plan is to have three releases per year. Furthermore, the technical infrastructure for the newsletter has changed: 
Since Modelica Association is migrating to "Software-as-a-Service" platforms to minimize our maintenance burden,  the legacy Modelica Association Newsletter application is replaced by a new GitHub based publishing process.

The Modelica Association board was newly elected on March 21, for the coming two years period.
The [new board](https://www.modelica.org/association) is identical to the previous board with the following exceptions:

- Hilding Elmqvist, one of the founders of the Modelica Association,
  did not longer apply for the *Technology* board position. In an email to the 
  Modelica Association members Hilding wrote: *I have been on the board in different positions from the start and I now think it’s time for younger members to push forward*.    
  Torsten Blochwitz from ESI-ITI was elected for the board position for *Technology.* The goal of this position is in particular to improve the coordination of the different standardization activities of MA.

- Thomas Beutlich from ESI-ITI was elected as leader for the MA Project *Libraries*. 
  As a deputy for this project, Dietmar Winkler from University College of Southeast Norway was elected.
  Note, this MA Project recently improved its [project rules](https://github.com/modelica/MAP-LIB_ProjectRules)
  in order that the development of the Modelica Standard Library is improved.

In October last year, MA had a one-day Modelica Association Strategy Meeting to discuss the future of MA. Several of the ideas and suggestions developed at this workshop are on the way to be implemented to improve the operation of MA. To mention a few:

- In April, MA will start its Back Office operated by [LTX](http://www.ltx.de/english.html).
  The MA board can then delegate administrative tasks to its back office to offload work
  and to improve the administrative processes.

- The MA board and interested MA projects get more budget freedom.
  In particular, the MA Project FMI will now have its own budget for the coming year,
   e.g., to organize the further development of the FMI compliance checker or
   the FMI cross check in a more effective way.

- The MA newsletter is reactivated with a new newsletter editor and a new technical infrastructure.

- The FMI cross check results are currently moved to a modern infrastructure
  designed and implemented by Michael Tiller, see [article below](#updated-fmi-cross-check-process).

- The MA bylaws will be slightly adapted in the near future, in particular to allow voting and anonymous
  elections via teleconference services, so that physical presence at a meeting is no
  longer needed in order to influence decisions of MA.

In order to enlarge the Modelica and FMI community, MA has changed its strategy regarding
Modelica conferences. Previously, the International Modelica Conference took place every 18 months in Europe.
This is changed now:

- The International Modelica Conference will take place every 2 years in March in Europe.
  The next one will take place in **March 4-6, 2019** in Regensburg Germany.

- In the year between International Modelica Conferences,
  Modelica Conferences shall be organized on other continents with country specific focus.
  In 2018, the following conferences of this kind will take place:

  - The [second Japanese Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018japan)
    will take place **May 17-19, 2018** in Tokyo, Japan.

  - The [first American Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018Americas)
    will take place **Oct. 8-10, 2018** in Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.


If you would like to organize a Modelica Conference, please inspect the Modelica Conference series
[web page](https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference).

If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI community, please follow the
[submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html). 
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is **Fr. July 20, 2018**.

Martin Otter on March 23, 2018    
(Chairman of the Modelica Association)
