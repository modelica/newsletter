The Modelica langauge has clearly attracted a portion of the power system modeling community. Every year there are dozens of works addressing modern aspects 
in power system modeling applications. These applications are facilitated by great capabilities and potentials of the Modelica language. Unfortionately, the 
majority of interested parties and individuals won't be aware about all such conducted works alltogether. Thus, there is always an increasing demand for an 
educational uptodate (e-)book that gathers these works in a well-organized and an entertaining manner.
