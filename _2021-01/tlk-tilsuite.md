The TIL Suite is a comprehensive Modelica library for stationary and transient simulations of thermodynamic systems.
In April the TIL Suite 3.10.0 will be released with the following improvements:

 - TIL, TILMedia and add-on libraries are compatible with Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0
 - In cross-flow heat exchangers with moist air, inhomogeneous flow due to e.g. water condensation or icing can be considered
 - Some pressure drop and heat transfer correlations have been numerically improved and become more robust
 - In TIL, many summary expansions and more consistent naming have been made. This requires an automatic conversion to be performed during the model upgrade to TIL 3.10 & Modelica 4

Besides the TIL release the following models are available in add-on packages:

 - Hydrogen refueling systems with a detailed vehicle pressure vessel type III or type IV
 - Hot water tanks as in domestic buildings for heating and hot water supply
