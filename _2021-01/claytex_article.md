Claytex publishes a [technical blog]( https://www.claytex.com/blog/) covering all things Modelica and Dymola.  


#### Trajectory File – what is it? Dissecting a Dymola result file.

Trajectory file is the result file format of Modelica. At first glance, it appears to be a standard .mat file. If you have ever tried to open it, then you will have seen that it is not! Results data is stored in a logical, if not immediately intuitive, way. We’ll take a closer look at what each element of the trajectory file is, and what they mean in this blog post.

#### Working with the Working Directory? 

Like many programs, Dymola makes use of a working directory on your computer. Dynamically associated with Dymola, it acts as a location to write files required by Dymola. By virtue of being dynamically linked to Dymola, the working directory is very much a living part of the Dymola process. Therefore, having a solid understanding of how Dymola utilizes the working directory helps us while working with Dymola. We’ll cover both how Dymola uses the working directory and some recommended practices for users. I will also highlight some potential pitfalls and quirks of the Dymola working directory and discuss them as they arise.
