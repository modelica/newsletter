"Aircraft Electrical System" is a Modelica-based library for the simulation of onboard electrical networks. The library enhances the Modelica world by flexible and detailed modeling of large power networks.

Highlights include:
- Easy definition of electrical network loads including power per flight phase, bus allocation on AC and DC buses, ATA chapter, wiring, and many more,
- First tabular and graphical analysis of the loading and generator balancing,
- Transfer of the tabular load definition into a Modelica database,
- A database fed modeling framework of the electrical network based on generic components for power generation, conversion, and consumption,
- Library of architectures and components for modeling of the onboard electrical network.
- Test examples, including a demonstration using a generic two engine long-range transport aircraft architecture.
Usage is focused on, but not limited to, aircraft, and can be adapted for any type of stationary and mobile power system.
