Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

the [International Modelica Conference will take place on Mo. Sept. 20 - Fr. Sept. 24, 2021](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/). 
The conference is a pure virtual/online conference. The conference is **free**, but you must register in order to participate. 
The conference will take place partially in the morning and partially in the afternoon with respect to the CET time zone, 
to give people from different time zones the possibility to participate. The [call-for-papers page](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/call2021.html) 
is open  and you are encouraged to submit **full scientific papers**, **extended abstracts for industrial user presentations** and/or proposals
for **tutorials** and **vendor sessions**. The industrial user
presentations should be related to existing or planned Modelica Association standards (Modelica language, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI). 
Final deadline for scientific papers submissions is **April 26, 2021** and for industrial user presentations **June 15, 2021**.
Note, the conference will be financed solely via **sponsoring**. So, please consider to contribute.

The new Modelica Association Project **eFMI** (FMI for embedded systems) has been accepted by the Modelica Association members. 
This exciting new project is orthogonal to FMI, by standardizing various interfaces for tool chains to
transform physics-based models (say, a Modelica model) to production code on embedded systems, in particular
on automotive electronic control units. An alpha release of eFMI was developed in the 
[ITEA3 project EMPHYSIS](https://emphysis.github.io/), together with 13 tool prototypes.
The tool chains have been tested with 200 [MISRA-C](https://www.misra.org.uk/) compliant C-Codes generated from 
40 Modelica/Amesim models and evaluated with 11 industrial use cases. Once eFMI is released and
eFMI compliant tools are available, there will be the great opportunity to 
significantly reduce cost and time for the software development of
**advanced, physics-based control and diagnosis functions on embedded devices**.
More details are given in the [eFMI article below](#map-efmi-kickoff). 

The [Modelica Association Contributor License Agreement is now publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaAssociationCLA)
in markdown format. The release contains the [pdf-version](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaAssociationCLA/releases/download/1.1.1/ModelicaAssociationCLA_1.1.1.pdf)
that was automatically generated from the markdown version. In case, you think improvements/changes are needed,
submit an issue or pull request.

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities,
please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. August 13, 2021.
