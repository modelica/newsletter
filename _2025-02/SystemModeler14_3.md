The upcoming release of **System Modeler 14.3** introduces powerful new features for users who want more than just drag-and-drop modeling. Whether you're working within the System Modeler interface or harnessing the full capabilities of the **Wolfram Language**, you gain flexible tools for simulation, analysis, and rich post-processing.

### Key highlights:

- *Automated Design Validation*: Define high-level performance and safety requirements and automatically verify them—powered by Wolfram Language.  
- *Live Tuning During Simulation*: Modify gains, time constants, or other parameters on the fly—without stopping or recompiling your model.  
- *Simulate Using Calendar Time*: Set simulation periods using real-world dates and generate time-aware plots for clearer, more contextual insights.

**Stay tuned—System Modeler 14.3 is just around the corner!**

The full list of new features will be available at [wolfram.com/system-modeler/what-is-new](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/what-is-new/) upon release.
