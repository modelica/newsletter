Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

This newsletter is full of anticipation for our upcoming main event: the [16th international Modelica & FMI conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/)!
Our standards progress and so does the format of our conference. We decided very early on to make it a Modelica & FMI conference so that even people only interested in one of our standards can enjoy a full program. We have further strengthened this by elevating the Industrial User presentation to have their own track enabling a better exchange within industry experts but also between industry and academia. You can plan your visit with the [preliminary program](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/16thModelicaFMI_PrelProgram.pdf).



The different scientific tracks nicely represent the multi-faceted aspects of our standards: 

- The use of models in AI and the use of AI in models have revitalized classic control applications. Hence the topic “Control and AI” forms its own track. The first [keynote of Mishra Siddhartha](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes) will enhance this topic.
- Energy systems have always played a dominant part in the Modelica ecosystem and enjoy their track. The second [keynote by Johan Åkesson](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes) further stresses this point.
- The track on FMI and related (layered) standards goes just beyond the usage of our standards. Advanced handling of meta-information and the integration into MBSE workflows are major topics.
- and last but not least: where else shall you discuss the development of equation-based modeling and their tooling than in a track for “General Modelica” at our conference?

I want to thank all the reviewers and my fellows from the conference board on the tremendous effort they have put into their reviewing effort. Most importantly, I want to express my highest gratitude towards all our authors and contributors. This exciting program would not have been possible without all your work that went into creating these submissions. 

The eagerness of our community to contribute to the greater good and to educate is best displayed by the tutorials. We can offer [15 tutorials](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/Tutorial_Abstracts_16th_Modelica_and_FMI_Conference.pdf) in parallel. This is fantastic to see and fortunately we have with the HSLU also a wonderful venue that is able to stage all these sessions. Do not forget to fill out the [tutorial questionnaire](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/en/e/d590fb98fe94c51b446157009fca9395-1294761) once you have registered for the conference!

Being part of the conference board, I also appreciate the strong commitment of our sponsors. I want to thank our Platinum sponsor [LTX](https://www.ltx.de/english.html), our gold sponsors [Dassault Systèmes](https://www.3ds.com/), [Modelon](https://modelon.com/), [Tongyuan](https://www.tongyuan.cc/)  and our silver sponsors [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/), [Wolfram](https://www.wolfram.com/index.en.html?source=footer), [xRG](https://xrg-simulation.de/en), [Orthogonal](https://www.orthogonal.dev/), [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/), [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/),  [exxcellent](https://www.exxcellent.de/), [ClayTex](https://www.claytex.com/). If you want to learn more about them, visit the vendor session at the evening of day 1.  Most of them will be also present by a booth for the full duration of the conference. Also more sponsors may still be joining the conference.

I hope that you will enjoy the refreshed format and the packed program and that I will see many of you at the conference.

#### Panel Discussion

For the first time at the International Modelica Conference, we will have a Penel discussion. The topic is: **Open Standards vs. Open source, Collaboration or Conflict?**.

We choose panelist from a braod range of companies and organizations using Modelica for their product design and research. Our distinguished Panelists are:

- Adam Moravanszky, Senior Director Simulation Technology,  NVIDIA
- Clément Coïc, Technology Cluster Lead - Digital Mechatronics, Siemens Healthineers
- Dirk Zimmer (Chairman Modelica Association), Coordinator for M&S Methods and Tools, DLR
- Marius Dupuis, CEO, ASAM e.V.
- Michael Wetter, Computational Senior Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
- Ulrich Schulmeister, VP Technology and Engineering, Robert Bosch GmbH

The panel discussion will evolve around a few prepared questions, and questions from the audience. It will be moderated by our board member Hubertus Tummescheit, (Board member Modelica Association), President Model Based Innovation LLC. 

#### Post Conference Activity

For many of us, the conference is also an ideal opportunity to meet in person. This shall be exploited beyond the main event.

To get important feedback from our user-base, we stage an FMI Advisory Meeting (register [via email](mailto:contact@fmi-standard.org)) and also a Modelica Advisory Meeting ([register here](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/en/b/b8ceacb2fd2032bbbf901583f997f728-1284258)) on Thursday morning right after the conference. These events are open for everyone who wants to give use feedback, present challenges or propose improvements.

From Thursday afternoon to Friday afternoon, we have hold meetings for the individual working groups and for the overall coordination and strategy of our association.

These meetings are for Modelica Association members only. Registration info has been communicated by email.

#### Modelica in China

I have decided to visit our Modelica user base in China and hence have undertaken a journey through 6 cities in mainland China this May. This journey let me exchange with Modelica and FMI users, with academia, with industry and with main tool developers and consultants in systems engineering from various technical fields.

I think it is nearly impossible to return as a European from China and not being impressed. Its industry is firing on all cylinders but even more so, the spirit of growth and relentless progress is permeating through its society as a whole. It is a tangible and useful form of progress benefitting wealth, technology, environmental protection and health.

Yet, I was still surprised to see how many fellow Modelicans there are in this country. Indeed, there might be more users of Modelica in China than in the rest of the world combined! For this fortunate situation, we have to thank the initiatives and hard work of many individuals and organizations, both local companies with their own independent tooling and international companies importing software. Chinese teaching material is being created, a Chinese version of the MSL 4.0 exists and demand comes from all industry sectors (and all means all in China).

Despite this fortunate situation, we shall not overlook that the Modelica Association is lacking awareness in China and that some efforts are fragmented. As an international association we have to strengthen Modelica as a community where people help and educate each other. This effort shall also focus on China but not being limited to it and apply for Asia as a whole.  

I will come back to this topic in future newsletters and report on very concrete actions that are undertaken in this direction. For now, I want to express my gratitude for all the hospitality I did receive from university professors and their students, from industrial groups, companies and vendors. There are simply too many people to mention here but I was feeling truly honored to have the opportunity to hold lectures and fully enjoyed the technical discussions.

A special thank you goes to Dr. Rui Gao. Without his planning and coordination, the trip would have simply been impossible. I am also extremely grateful to Dr. Aiguo Xu and Ms. Jiayan Zhou from SimTek who have greatly supported this trip all the way (so many organizational things and so many miles travelled) and to Dr. Fanli Zhou from Tongyuan for hosting me in my final destination in Suzhou.

As it turns out, this introduction to the newsletter got quite lengthy. I promise to be more concise in the future but it might be also a good sign that there are so many important developments to report on.

Have fun with the newsletter and see you at the conference!
