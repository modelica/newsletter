Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

This newsletter is full of anticipation for our upcoming main event: the 16th international Modelica & FMI conference!
Our standards progress and so does the format of our conference. We decided very early on to make it a Modelica & FMI conference so that even people only interested in one of our standards can enjoy a full program. We have further strengthened this by elevating the Industrial User presentation to have their own track enabling a better exchange within industry experts but also between industry and academia. 
[Link to full program]
The different scientific tracks nicely represent the multi-faceted aspects of our standards: 

- The use of models in AI and the use of AI in models have revitalized classic control applications. Hence the topic “Control and AI” forms its own track. The first keynote of Mishra Siddhartha will enhance this topic.
- Energy systems have always played a dominant part in the Modelica ecosystem and enjoy their track. The second keynote by Johan Åkesson further stresses this point.
- The track on FMI and related (layered) standards goes just beyond the usage of our standards. Advanced handling of meta-information and the integration into MBSE workflows are major topics.
- and last but not least: where else shall you discuss the development of equation-based modeling and their tooling than in a track for “General Modelica” at our conference?

I want to thank all the reviewers and my fellows from the conference board on the tremendous effort they have put into their reviewing effort. Most importantly, I want to express my highest gratitude towards all our authors and contributors. This exciting program would not have been possible without all your work that went into creating these submissions. 
The eagerness of our community to contribute to the greater good and to educate is best displayed by the tutorials. We can offer 15 tutorials in parallel. This is fantastic to see and fortunately we have with the HSLU also a wonderful venue that is able to stage all these sessions. Do not forget to fill out the tutorial questionnaire once you have registered for the conference!
Being part of the conference board, I also appreciate the strong commitment of our sponsors. I want to thank our Platinum sponsor LTX, our gold sponsor […]  and our silver sponsors […]. If you want to learn more about them, visit the vendor session at the evening of day 1. Most of them will be also present by a booth for the full duration of the conference. 
I hope that you will enjoy the refreshed format and the packed program and that I will see many of you at the conference.

## Post Conference Activity

For many of us, the conference is also an ideal opportunity to meet in person. This shall be exploited beyond the main event. 
To get important feedback from our user-base, we stage an FMI Advisory Meeting (register here) and also a Modelica Advisory Meeting (register here) on Thursday morning right after the conference. These events are open for everyone who wants to give use feedback, present challenges or propose improvements.
From Thursday afternoon to Friday afternoon, we have hold meetings for the individual working groups and for the overall coordination and strategy of our association. 
These meetings are for Modelica Association members only. You can register here. 

## Modelica in China

I have decided to visit our Modelica user base in China and hence have undertaken a journey through 6 cities in mainland China this May. This journey let me exchange with Modelica and FMI users, with academia, with industry and with main tool developers and consultants in systems engineering from various technical fields.
I think it is nearly impossible to return as a European from China and not being impressed. Its industry is firing on all cylinders but even more so, the spirit of growth and relentless progress is permeating through its society as a whole. It is a tangible and useful form of progress benefitting wealth, technology, environmental protection and health.
Yet, I was still surprised to see how many fellow Modelicans there are in this country. Indeed, there might be more users of Modelica in China than in the rest of the world combined!
For this fortunate situation, we have to thank the initiatives and hard work of many individuals and organizations, both local companies with their own independent tooling and international companies importing software. Chinese teaching material is being created, a Chinese version of the MSL 4.0 exists and demand comes from all industry sectors (and all means all in China).
Despite this fortunate situation, we shall not overlook that the Modelica Association is lacking awareness in China and that some efforts are fragmented. As an international association we have to strengthen Modelica as a community where people help and educate each other. This effort shall also focus on China but not being limited to it and apply for Asia as a whole.  
I will come back to this topic in future newsletters and report on very concrete actions that are undertaken in this direction. For now, I want to express my gratitude for all the hospitality I did receive from university professors and their students, from industrial groups, companies and vendors. There are simply too many people to mention here but I was feeling truly honored to have the opportunity to hold lectures and fully enjoyed the technical discussions.
A special thank you goes to Dr. Rui Gao. Without his planning and coordination, the trip would have simply been impossible. I am also extremely grateful to Dr. Aiguo Xu and Ms. Jiayan Zhou from SimTek who have greatly supported this trip all the way (so many organizational things and so many miles travelled) and to Dr. Fanli Zhou from Tongyuan for hosting me in my final destination in Suzhou.

As it turns out, this introduction to the newsletter got quite lengthy. I promise to be more concise in the future but it might be also a good sign that there many important developments to report on. 
Have fun with the newsletter and see you at the conference!
Dirk Zimmer
