Want to get practical experience with TLK Energy’s **Process Systems Library (PSL)**? 

PSL is a flexible, Modelica-based library developed for the dynamic simulation and optimization of complex energy and process systems — including **Power-to-X (PtX)** processes, **Carbon Capture** technologies, and integrated energy systems. Thanks to its modular structure and open standards, PSL enables engineers to build tailored, scalable models that can be adapted to specific project requirements.
