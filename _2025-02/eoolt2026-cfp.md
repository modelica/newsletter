# [EOOLT 2026: 10th International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Modeling Languages and Tools](https://eoolt.org/2026/)

### Hochschule Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences, Bielefeld, Germany

### June 15, 2026

### First call for papers

Many engineers rely heavily on model-based design and control of complex cyber-physical systems. Of paramount importance is the ability to capture all central aspects of such systems in the models, including the physical behavior of the system components and the architecture description of its software and hardware. This calls for a special class of modelling languages: hybrid modeling languages based on equations that support both continuous-time and event-based aspects. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS and Simulink/Simscape are prominent examples. Using such a language offers a number of advantages: models can be reused, integration can be tested in an early design phase, and simulation code can be generated for a number of different platforms.

The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages and explores topics that aim to overcome limits of their expressiveness, correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain specific languages, are of particular interest.

Contributions to this workshop focus on methodological aspects and describe new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition to full contributions, shorter work-in-progress papers are welcome, offering an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.

Typical subjects of the EOOLT workshop range from language design via modeling aspects to simulation code:

* Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics
* Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages
* Verification, type systems, and early static checking
* Discrete-event and hybrid system modeling
* Acausality / non-causality and its role in model reusability
* Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages
* Model-driven development related to EOO languages
* Equation-based modeling in the frame of system engineering
* Reflection and meta-programming
* Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging
* Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics
* Code generation for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, and distributed systems
* Tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models

### Important dates

### Submission guidelines

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit the following contributions:

* **Full length research papers**: up to 10 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, benchmarks, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics.
* **Work-in-progress papers**: up to 4 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of work-in-progress and open problem statements that can be thoroughly discussed during the workshop.
All submissions must describe original research work, not previously published or submitted for publication elsewhere. The program committee will evaluate the papers' technical contributions, relevance, originality, correctness, and clarity.

All papers should be submitted using the EasyChair conference management system.
