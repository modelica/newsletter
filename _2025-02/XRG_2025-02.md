On the Modelica Conference 2025 in Lucerne XRG will be present with a **booth**, informative **vendor session**, an extensive **tutorial** on AI integration into Modelica and two **scientific talks** (see below). We will be happy to meet you in Lucerne!

### Our Booth

Stefan Wischhusen ([book a meeting by e-mail](mailto:wischhusen@xrg-simulation.de?subject=Meeting%20request)) and his team are looking forward to meeting you at our booth in the exhibition area. You are welcome to visit us for an eye-to-eye conversation at any time.

### Our Vendor Presentation: Closing the gap between Modelica and the rest of the world – XRG’s portfolio goes AI!

**Mon., 8th 16:45-18:45**

In this presentation, we will begin by showcasing the significant enhancements in the classic XRG Modelica Libraries for thermal energy system simulation, relevant use cases and how to deploy results to industrial product development. These libraries are a foundation to next-level surrogate and machine-learning modelling which is enabled by XRG’s newest Modelica library [SMArtInt+](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint). The multi-tool library closes the gap between data-driven and physical Modelica modelling through its powerful tool-chain and user assistance which are crucial for real-life product integration. 

And not to forget: XRG is celebrates its 20th anniversary with a special offer … the new **[XRG Suite](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/xrg-suite)**!

### Our tutorial: Using SMArtInt+ - Machine-learning and easy integration of artificial intelligence in Modelica

**Mon., 8th 13:30-16:45** 

There is an increasing need for hybrid models consisting of physical and machine-learning model parts. XRG has developed the **[SMArtInt+ Library](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint)**, that enables the easy generation and integration of **neural networks** from different sources and types (e.g., TensorFlow, ONNX, Julia, etc.). This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to the use of this library. The main use case is the creation of a hybrid model for a thermodynamic application.

### Our Talks

Two interesting XRG talks about **AI integration** and **HVAC modelling** have made it to the program:

 - Tim Jonas Hanke et al.:**"Status of the SMArtInt Library - Simple Modelica Artificial Intelligence Interface"**, Tue., 8th 11:10 
 - Boudewijn von Groos, Alje van Dam, Carsten von Ohlen et al.:**"Modelica driven development of the thermal management control system for a zero emission yacht"**, Wed., 9th 12:15 
 
Our colleagues will be happy to answer your questions during the discussion.
