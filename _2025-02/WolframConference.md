At this year’s conference, you’ll explore how to:

- Automatically validate performance and safety requirements in your Modelica models  
- Build connected, scalable solutions—from LLM plugins and apps to packages and full production systems  
- Implement innovative online learning, apply computational thinking across curricula, and harness the full power of computation  

Engage with Wolfram developers and industry experts as they share how real-world products are designed, simulated, and deployed using the Wolfram ecosystem.

- **Dates**: November 5–7
