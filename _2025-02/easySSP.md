#### orchideo | easySSP v1.4.2 released

The new **easySSP version 1.4.2** introduces **hierarchical parameter handling** for component synchronization, making it easier to display and override parameters defined at higher system levels. Additionally, a new merge function for parameter bindings allows for more efficient consolidation of parameter configurations.

Building on existing functionality, **subsystems and components** can now be exported and imported as **System Structure Description (SSD)** files. Components can reference SSDs for improved reuse, and a new **convert feature** enables seamless switching between systems and components — while preserving connectors, parameters, and metadata.

**Workflow capabilities** have also been extended: **dynamic workflow parts** and **workflow variables** now enable a more flexible, user-specific process guidance and documentation. Moreover, multiple workflows can be bundled within a single SSP container and selected via the navigation bar.

To further support metadata exchange and model reuse, easySSP now offers flexible **import and export of classifications** in the **Simulation Resource Metadata (SRMD)** format, covering all metadata scopes within the app.


**easySSP** is based entirely on open standards like **SSP**, **FMI**, and **SSP Traceability**. Learn more at [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com).
