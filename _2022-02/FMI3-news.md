#### FMI 3.0 release

The FMI 3.0 standard has been released on May 10th 2022 with many improvements and extensions compared to FMI 2.0.
For more information see the press release https://fmi-standard.org/news/2022/05/10/fmi-3.0-release.html.

#### FMI 2.0.4 Release Candidate 1

We would like to ask you for a final review of the FMI 2.0.4 Release Candidate 1.
You can find the document and a summary of changes here:  https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.4-rc.1. 
In case of findings, please open issues on https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/issues.

Besides smaller fixes, this maintenance release contains two backports of FMI 3.0 features: 

* Terminals and Icons https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmiTerminalsAndIcons, and
* Build Configuration https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#BuildConfiguration.

They are “orthogonal” to the existing FMI 2.0.x features: The API and modelDescription.xml will not be touched; only two new .xml files will be added that provide new functionality for “terminals and icons” and “build configuration”. Our intention is to speed up adoption of these FMI 3.0 features by backporting them to FMI 2.0.

#### New FMI Project Leader and Deputy

On May 5, 2022 the FMI Steering Committee has unanimously elected Christian Bertsch, BOSCH, as the new project leader and Torsten Sommer, Dassault Systèmes, as the new deputy.

The FMI Steering Committee wants to thank the outgoing project leader Andreas Junghanns, Synopsys, and deputy Torsten Blochwitz, ESI Group, for their longstanding leadership of the FMI Project and great merits to the development of the FMI standard - from the beginning until the recent release of FMI 3.0!
