A dedicated FMI component view shows details about an FMI component, its variables and existing mappings.
The new synchronization view lets you compare, validate and sync FMI components with component hulls on system architecture level, which reduces integration, update and validation of FMI components to just a few clicks.


#### SSP Traceability and Metadata
orchideo \| easySSP supports the open SSP Traceability layer built on top of SSP to exchange important process information with stakeholders and collaborators.
