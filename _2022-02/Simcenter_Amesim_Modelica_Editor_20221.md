[Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/ ) is proud to announce that Simcenter Amesim 2022.1 is available since April 2022, as part of its system simulation solutions. Among the key features introduced in this release, we can highlight the Modelica related improvements below.

#### Modelica Editor 2022.1
Modelica Editor is an integrated development application dedicated to editing Modelica code. More than a tool to be used during the design and modeling phase of a Modelica model, Modelica Editor allows you to generate bridges between the acausal world of Modelica and the causal environment of Simcenter Amesim.

The improvements introduced in Modelica Editor 2022.1 are the following:
* Modelica Compiler (Modelonâ€™s Optimica Compiler Toolkit) upgraded to version 1.32
* The Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0 supported, with an exception for the **Clocked** package
* The standardized Simcenter Amesim has been upgraded to the version 1.1, containing now the array interfaces and new demos

And thanks to the media property assistant provided in the **Thermal Hydraulic library**, the media used in Simcenter Amesim can be adjusted according to the properties described in Modelica, thus obtaining continuous thermodynamic properties between both worlds.
