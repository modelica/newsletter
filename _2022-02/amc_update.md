We would like to invite you to the American Modelica Conference 2022, which will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the [Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center](https://davidson-gundy.utdallas.edu/davidson-gundy/spaces/) from October 26â€“28, 2022.  It is organized by [NAMUG](https://namug.org/), the North American Modelica Users Group, in cooperation with the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association).  We are excited about this first opportunity since 2019 to meet our Modelica colleagues in person; if you are unable to attend physically, we will also provide the ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.

We will present two conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences on a wide range of topics and applications, from aerospace to robotics to power systems to building systems, as well as a track of industrial user-oriented presentations with peer-reviewed abstracts that are not accompanied by a full scientific paper.  The conference keynotes and presentations will be presented on October 26-27, and we will also host an additional set of free workshops on a range of topics on October 28.  Remaining deadlines for publications are as follows: 

- September 1st, 2022: Submission of final papers and one-page abstracts
- October 7th, 2022: Submission of final presentations

More information about the conference can be found in [this announcement](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/).  

**Early bird registration** is currently open [on our EventBrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2022-tickets-193515990537), and the deadline for this reduced registration fee has been extended to August 22, 2022.  This year's Platinum Sponsor is [Ricardo Software](https://software.ricardo.com/), but Gold and Silver sponsorships are also still available.

We look forward to seeing you in Texas!
