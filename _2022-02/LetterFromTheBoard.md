Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

the following decisions have been made at the **annual Modelica Association meeting**:
- The Modelica Association board was elected (this election takes place every two years). All previous board members were re-elected
  with the following exceptions: 
  - The previous FMI project leader Andreas Junghanns (Synopsys) and the FMI deputy Torsten Blochwitz (ESI Group)
    resigned. We want to thank them for leading this very successful project from the beginning until the release of FMI 3.0!
    The FMI group has elected Christian Bertsch (BOSCH) as the new FMI project leader and Torsten Sommer (Dassault Systèmes) as the new FMI deputy.
    The Modelica Association members ratified this election.
  - The SSP group elected Pierre Mai (PMSF) for the new SSP deputy position and the 
    Modelica Association members ratified this election.
- The new [Compliance and Antitrust Guidelines of the Modelica Association](https://github.com/modelica/MA-Bylaws/blob/master/MA-ComplianceAndAntitrustStatement.md)
  were accepted by the Modelica Association members.
- The FMI 3.0 release with its [many new features](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmi-whats-new) was released by the
  FMI group and ratified by the Modelica Association members.
