Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

The new year starts with a new release of one of our standards: SSP2.0 has been released as Christmas present but if you have not taken notice yet, you may very well choose to enjoy it as an Easter egg:

https://ssp-standard.org/news/2024-12-20-ssp-2-0-release/

Whereas SSP (such as all our standards) has been carefully crafted to be generically applicable to a wide set of applications, one major driver for these efforts is the automotive industry. Hence, we welcome the increasing exchange and collaboration of the Modelica Association and [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/) whose primary aim is the standardization for automotive developments.  

Regarding another important industry sector, we are also very glad to welcome [Liebherr Aerospace Toulouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsQzL5I5Ok) as new organizational member of the Modelica Association. Having one of the most important aerospace companies joining us is a significant gain for our community.

Standards such SSP are by their nature quite abstract in their description and hence the Modelica Association will increase its effort in providing suitable demonstration and educational material. One opportunity for a first introduction will be our next [International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) September 8-10 in Lucerne Switzerland: Here you can both join beginner tutorials as well as experts talks on the recent developments.
Of course, we invite you all to also contribute to this conference:
-	[Scientific paper](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/authors/) deadline is **April 17**
-	Deadline for [Industrial presentations and tutorials](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/call2025/) is **June 1**
-	The exhibition space offers an attractive [platform for our sponsors](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/callforsponsors25/) as well as the vendor session.

Furthermore we are proud to announce our keynote speakers:
- Mishra Siddhartha, Professor and Deputy Head of the Seminar for Applied Mathematics at ETH Zürich
- Johan R Åkesson, Associate Director for Computational Engineering at Carrier, Former CTO Modelon AB

While we mostly look forward to our upcoming events, I also want to personally reflect on the last events that I experienced myself.

I want to thank Daeoh Kang and Yongha Han from South Korea as well as their whole team for taking the initiative to organize the [Asian Modelica Conference 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzdFK4601Fs). It was great to see so many applications of Modelica & FMI taking place in Asia generally and Korea specifically. To further strengthen our ties with Asia, I am currently planning a visit to China this May and meet Modelicans and new users from academia and industry.

Another joyful event was the annual [OpenModelica Workshop](https://openmodelica.org/events/openmodelica-workshop/2025/) in Linköping, Sweden. The progress in coverage and usability on the open-source tooling were remarkable and hence the discussions in the panel focused on future directions such as lowering the barrier of entry for new users and the integration of AI tools. These are not only topics relevant to OpenModelica but to the Modelica Association as a whole and hence will be part of our next Project Coordination meeting end of March.
