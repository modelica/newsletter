XRG celebrates its **20th anniversary** this year. The company was founded to deliver premium thermal system simulations to industrial customers with - at that time being - the relatively new Modelica modelling language. Today, we see a broad acceptance of this technology and a simple equation holds: **Energy simulation = Modelica simulation**. If you like to learn about our milestones from 2005 until the present day, please refer to:

#### Modelica Library Announcements

![HumanComfort 2.19.0 features](HumanComfortIrradiation.png 'HumanComfort irradiation demo')

**HumanComfort Library 2.19.0** offers a more detailed calculation of surface temperatures due to direct solar irradiation. 
The new approach, which is only available for the coarse grid CFD models, determines which individual surfaces are actually exposed to short-wave irradiation entering through windows of the air-conditioned space. 
For this the current time-dependent sun position (zenith and azimuth) is taken into account. This general feature is also applied to use cases like automotive cabins when the grid model is used. While changes in average air temperatures will be low, local changes can be stronger.
  
Moreover, the new incidence angle model in opaque surfaces computes angle dependent transmission coefficients for the material, which might improve accuracy of irradiation and surface temperatures. 

![HVAC Library 3.4.0 features](HVACPressureMode.png 'HVAC presssure mode demo')

**HVAC Library 3.4.0** for HVAC system simulation comes with significant new features:

 - Optionally, liquid systems can now be simulated with **detailed hydraulic parameters**. This paves the way to **hydraulic balancing simulations**. During the dynamic simulation the pump's pressure curve matches the system curve at any time and imbalances in mass flow (and energy) distribution can be investigated throughout the network. The classic performance-oriented approach is still available and switching between both modes with minimal interaction becomes possible. First industrial use cases gave positive feedback on this new feature.
 - **Overall weather data files** can be imported with one click. This convenient mode starts with the popular **Energy+ weather file format (.epw)** which is automatically converted to hourly input files. [Learn more ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDxUXLGxI4)         

![ClaRa Library Logo] (ClaRaPlus176.png 'ClaRaPlus Logo')

**ClaRa+ Library 1.7.6** for energy system simulation provides these new features:

 - A fast and efficient model for **water-hammer** effects in fluid flow has been included. The 1D finite volume model for fluid flow in pipes is suitable to simulate water-hammer effects accounting for possible formation of vapour cavities.  Numerical oscillations due to finite volume discretization are damped by eigenvalue shifting​ and the speed of sound in the fluid is corrected for the wall properties. This feature was successfully validated with experimental data. 
 - A **compressed gas storage tank** suitable for surface or salt cavern storage.​ The model can be used to model pressurized storage tanks for gaseous media regarding transient heat conduction to the surrounding material. 

#### OpenScaling

This month, XRG has gratefully received the approval to participate in [**ITEA4 OpenScaling**](https://itea4.org/project/openscaling.html) project from Apr. 2025 to Dec. 2026. The project aims to further enhance "open standards and established modelling and simulation tools to better support large-scale systems and distributed controllers optimized to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions". 

Our contribution is to further develop coarse grid CFD modelling in our [**HumanComfort Library**](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/humancomfort-library) and our artificial intelligence interface to Modelica [**SMArtInt**](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtIInt) and [**SMArtInt+**](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint).
