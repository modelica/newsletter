![orchideo easySSP now with SSP 2.0 and FMI 3.0 support, PDF workflow documentation and Modelica types](easySSP_banner.png 'orchideo  easySSP v1.4.1')

The **new easySSP version 1.4.1** introduces **support for the newly released SSP 2.0 standard** for import & export, modeling and  simulation, enabling improved exchange of system simulation models and architectures. This includes updates such as FMI 3.0-compatible data types, support for acausal modeling, and embedded Simulation Resource Metadata (SRMD).

Moreover easySSP's **FMI support has been extended to version 3.0**, allowing users to:

- Export FMI component hulls
- Integrate FMI components into system architectures
- Display FMI properties
- Synchronize FMI components with the SSP model
- Simulate SSP models with FMI components in easySSP

The workflow mechanism, which integrates with SSP and SSP Traceability, now offers a new option to **export the workflow documentation as PDF**.

Additionally, working with Modelica types in SSP models has been simplified - users can now directly select **Modelica-specific connectors and parameters** in the model editor.


**easySSP** is completely based on open standards like SSP, FMI and SSP Traceability. Check out [easy-ssp.com](https://easy-ssp.com) for more information!
