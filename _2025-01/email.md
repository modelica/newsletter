Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

Since a long time, the Modelica Association is more than just Modelica. It is managing a broad set of topics and doing so effectively by distributing the workload among its different Modelica Association Projects. However, there are common problems that require us to join forces across the projects. Hence this autumn we have re-initiated the coordination of our projects with a Modelica Coordination Meeting in Hamburg, Germany.
The four most important results of this discussion were:

- Provision of a free FMU import library. The Modelica Language group will then discuss extensions to the Modelica language to enable better means for FMU import across Modelica tools
- Development of free educational material in general to lower entry barrier for Modelica. 
- Development of free educational material for the use of SSP in modeling and simulation workflows
- Exploration of APIs for Modelica compilers to enable better integration into coding environments and AI tools or build toolchains.
