The demonstrated credibility of simulations to decision makers is one of the key challenges to make system simulation more widely accepted. 
This has been clearly shown e.g. by the ASSESS initiative of NAFEMS, see [ASSESS Credibility](https://www.nafems.org/community/assess/themes/credibility/). 

This critical topic is addressed in the SSP Traceability layered standard by the Modelica Association with a new standard to be released within the first half of this year. 
The SSP Traceability standard  provides standardized Documentation and Meta Data along the entire Process. It does so by building a **Chain of Trust** for Confident Simulation-Based Decision Making. 
This is achieved by establishing a digital thread of simulation-based evidence linking simulation processes to product requirements and KPIs, which makes simulation results for product decisions verifiable. 

SSP Traceability enables open, **Flexible & Scalable Credible Simulations** by documenting the relevant simulation process aspects in a traceable, consistent and standardized format that companies 
can tailor and scale to their credibility needs

The standard provides **Flexible and Standardized Metadata Exchange** through the built-in Simulation Resource Meta Data (SRMD) format. That format ensures a well-structured, 
flexible and efficient way to collect and share simulation metadata across the development lifecycle. 

In addition, the new standard facilitates **Model Reuse and Continuous Improvement**, because the well-documented SSP Traceability simulation resources facilitate 
the *reliable* reuse of existing simulations and models and the continuous improvement of simulation best practices, processes and resulting artefacts. 

SSP Traceability thus builds a bridge between process-oriented Systems Engineering (SE) and accuracy-oriented System Modeling and Simulation. The Modelica Association will 
work with other organizations, such as the [Object Management Group OMG]( https://www.omg.org/) to improve the interoperability between Modelica Standards, and SE-standards 
in the next steps to improve tool interoperability even further. [The current specification]( https://modelica.github.io/ssp-ls-traceability/master/) is available online. 
Comments by interested parties can be supplied in the [issue section of the github repository]( https://github.com/modelica/ssp-ls-traceability/issues). The Release of version 1.0 of SSP Traceability 
is planned for Q2 2025.
