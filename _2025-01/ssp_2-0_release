The Modelica Association has released **SSP 2.0**, marking a major milestone in the evolution of the **System Structure & Parameterization (SSP)** standard. Building on SSP 1.0, the new version expands capabilities for exchanging composite system models and simulation architectures, supporting FMI 3.0, Modelica components, and abstract simulation architectures.

Key advancements include:
- **Architecture Exchange** – Enhanced support for collaborative model refinement
- **Advanced Co-Simulation** – Improved robustness for complex system simulations incorporating FMI 3.0 features
- **Broader Component Support** – Integration of Modelica-based components
- **Virtual ECUs** – Seamless incorporation of FMI 3.0-based vECUs
- **Layered Standards & Metadata** – Strengthened interoperability and traceability
- **Next-Gen Digital Twins** – Enabling multi-layered system modeling
- **AI & Machine Learning** – Optimized parameter calibration for smart applications

With SSP 2.0, industries such as automotive, aerospace, energy, and manufacturing can push the boundaries of digital engineering, virtual prototyping, and AI-driven development.
