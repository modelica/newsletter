### Modelon Celebrates Twenty Years of Excellence in System Simulation

Two decades ago, Modelon was founded with a bold vision: to revolutionize system simulation by embracing an open standard for modeling and simulation—Modelica!
 
We're proud to see that vision come to life as we serve global industries with best-in-class modeling technology and continue to innovate, building the future of cloud-based simulation.

[Co-Founder Johan Andreasson wrote a reflection about our journey.](https://modelon.com/blog/twenty-years-of-excellence-in-system-simulation/)

### New in Modelon Impact

#### Analysis View

We now have a dedicated space for data visualization in Modelon Impact. While users can still configure graphs in the model view, they can now configure multiple plots and graphs simultaneously for comparative analysis. 

- In-Depth Comparisons: Compare different versions of the same model within a single graph.
- Flexible Graph Types: Choose between line, scatter, or histogram to visualize your data exactly how you want.
- Synced Scales & Zooms: Align your time scales and zoom levels across variable graphs for more seamless analysis.

##### Designing Closed-Loop Control Systems with Modelica

A well-designed closed-loop control system is the key to keeping systems stable, efficient, and responsive. Without it, performance suffers—often leading to instability and reduced lifespan. 
 
Engineers can develop high-fidelity control strategies that are tested and optimized inside Modelon Impact before real-world deployment. [Learn how.](https://modelon.com/blog/designing-closed-loop-control-systems-with-modelica/)
