With version 0.8 of the co-simulation master tool *MasterSim* ([bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim](https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim)) it is now possible to illustrate and manage simulation scenarios in a graphical network view.

Also, and that is probably more relevant to the growing number of users, a comprehensive manual is now available ([MasterSim Documentation](https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim/documentation.php)). It covers the user interface, implemented algorithms and the project file specification, thus giving all relevant information on controlling and running *MasterSim* in a scripted environment, for example when running systematic parameter studies.

*MasterSim* is an open-source software that was created with the aim to create a reference implementation for FMI co-simulation algorithms, giving developers of master tools and FMI slaves a transparant implementation to check and optimize their own implementations. The code and release installers are hosted on [sourceforge.net/projects/mastersim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mastersim).

The tool is now considered mature enough for production use and as such is already used in a couple of projects. Since translation of the Qt-based user interface is fairly easy to do, we would appreciate help of native speakers of other languages (besides english and german) to help in translating the user interface (contact: [andreas.nicolai@tu-dresden.de](mailto:andreas.nicolai@tu-dresden.de).
