The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations of thermal components and system models. The current version **3.8.0** includes among other things the following innovations:
<br/>
The Modelica **Homotopy** function is used in many TIL models. This function converts simplified model equations into the actual physical equations before the simulation starts, resulting in a very robust and stationary initialization. This alternative initialization method allows fast calculation of many different steady state operating points within a parameter study. Furthermore, the homotopy initialization allows the simulation start from a defined stationary state at given boundary conditions.
<br/>
New models and improvements of transport correlations are included in TIL 3.8.0.
