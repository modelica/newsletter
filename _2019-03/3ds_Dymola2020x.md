On 29 November 2019, Dymola 2020x will become generally available.

#### New user interface

The user interface of Dymola has been modernized to the benefit of both novice and experienced users. The new interface provides
easier access to all operations and has been re-grouped to better support the natural workflow of model development and simulation. 
The command interface is now ribbon-based with improved icons. All existing Dymola functionality is kept.

#### Simulation

Greatly improved translation and simulation time for certain types of large real-world models, due to better equation analysis. 
The updated code generation reduces memory requirement for the C-compilers and reduces compilation time by up to 60%.

Improved handling of algebraic loops decreases the simulation time up to 30−40 % for industrial models. 

#### FMI-Kit for Simulink

The FMI Kit for Simulink is now freely downloadable from GitHub, including source code: [link](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMIKit-Simulink) . This is unsupported free software.
