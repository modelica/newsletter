## FMI 2.0.1 released

After approval by the FMI Steering Committee and the Modelica Association members, version 2.0.1 of the FMI Specification 
has been released on Oct 31st 2019.
This is a maintenance release for FMI 2.0 with no new features, but bug fixes and clarifications to more than 50 issues.
FMUs created according to the FMI 2.0.1 specification are valid FMI 2.0 FMUs and vice versa.

The release notes and files to download can be found [here](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

## Towards FMI 3.0
All FMI Change Proposals described in the [FMI 3.0 features list](https://fmi-standard.org/faq/) have now already been merged into the master branch of the [FMI standard repository](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard). With this step, the API of the coming FMI 3.0 standard has been stabilized, so that prototyping of tools and improvement of the standard text can start now.
At their meeting in October in Lund the FMI Steering Committee accepted one new feature for FMI 3.0: the FMU ZIP Archive can now contain an additional folder with meta data to travel with the FMU, which can be modified by different tools, allowing for layered standards.

The development of the FMI standard can be followed on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard) for the sources 
of the standard text, headers and schema files, see also the [generated documentation](https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0-dev/) for
the latest devlopment version.
You are welcome to comment and contribute to the FMI 3.0 standard.
