Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

the celebration of the 100th Modelica Design Meeting was a big success: On Sept. 30, 2019 the Jubilee Symposium Future Directions of System Modeling and Simulation took place with 9 invited speakers and 140 participants [(...)](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2019-03/index#letter-from-the-board).

According to the new schedule, country-specific Modelica Association conferences will take place next year outside of Europe:
