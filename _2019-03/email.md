Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,

According to the new schedule, country-specific Modelica Association conferences will take place next year outside of Europe:

- The [2nd American Modelica Conference](https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2020Americas) will be held
at the University of Colorado in Boulder, U.S.A, from March 23-25, 2020. See also the [dedicated article](AmericanModelicaConference.html) in this newsletter.

- The previous two very successful Japanese Modelica Conferences are succeeded with the [Asian Modelica Conference](https://2020.asian.conference.modelica.org/) in Tokyo, Japan, from May 13-14, 2020. See also the
[dedicated article](Asian_Modelica_Conference.html) in this newsletter.
