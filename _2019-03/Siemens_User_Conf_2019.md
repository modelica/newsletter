#### Join us on December 2&ndash;4 for the 2019 Simcenter Conference - Europe

Join us on December 2&ndash;4 for the 2019 Simcenter Conference - Europe, an exciting event that will bring together simulation, test and design exploration in an industry themed agenda. 
Together we will explore how simulation and test are contributing to the realization of the Digital Twin, and examine how adopting a holistic approach to predictive engineering analytics is essential in developing innovative products that exceed customer expectations.

The Digital Twin, for product ideation, realization and utilization, is the state of the art approach companies follow to deliver innovation. Digitally mirroring the product over its entire life cycle can present several advantages, such as more effective development, better manufacturing precision, smarter product behavior and much more. The Simcenter simulation and testing solutions portfolio, built on the legacy of LMS solutions, CD-Adapco, Tass and Mentor, allows manufacturers to build and maintain a Digital Twin in support of performance engineering during product development.
