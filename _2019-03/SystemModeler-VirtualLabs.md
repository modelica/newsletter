How can you make teaching come alive and be more engaging? For many educators, the answer turns out to be not so much a single solution, but rather a set of tools that can vary according to subject and even by student. Wolfram has now added a new tool to the pedagogical toolkit: [Wolfram Virtual Labs](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/).

These are:

- Open education resources (OER).
- Designed to encourage student curiosity by allowing students to test ideas with immediate feedback in a programmatic environment.
- Created to make memorization easier.

The following Virtual Labs libraries are now available for download from the [SystemModeler library store](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/):

- [CollegeThermal](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/college-thermal/): Developed in collaboration with [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en). Contains interactive thermal labs related to heat transfer and thermal engineering courses.
- [HighSchoolBiology](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/high-school-biology/): Developed in collaboration with [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) and [VicSTEM](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/programs/learningdev/vicstem/Pages/wolframsoftware.aspx). Contains interactive biology labs related to cell transport phenomena, population models and food metabolism.
- [HighSchoolChemistry](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/high-school-chemistry/): Developed in collaboration with [Linköping University](https://liu.se/). Contains interactive chemistry labs related to rate laws, homogenous reactions and heterogenous reactions.

Stay tuned for upcoming libraries, including:

- HighSchoolPhysics
- CollegeElectricalAnalog
- CollegeMechanicalEngineering

The labs are developed using Mathematica notebooks with Modelica models running in the background. For more information, please read the [CollegeThermal release blog](https://blog.wolfram.com/2019/10/08/powering-engineering-education-with-wolfram-virtual-labs/).
