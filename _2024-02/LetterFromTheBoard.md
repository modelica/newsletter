Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

I am writing to you as the newly elected chairperson of the Modelica Association. After 25 years of inspiring leadership, we could honor the enormous contribution that Prof. Martin Otter made to this association since its official foundation in the year 2000 with a [celebratory colloquium](https://modelica.org/news/2024-05-28-new-board-elected/) in Munich. His never-ending drive for new technologies and his incredible know-how in system dynamics ensured that both Modelica and FMI became standards of world-wide recognition. Given this, the board is very grateful that he remains an active part of the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association/) in his new role in the board leading technology. 

I am very honored by the faith put in my person being elected by our members. It will be my privilege to ensure that Modelica as standard for mathematical modeling becomes even better accessible and easier to learn. We can be proud on the enormous success of the FMI-standard that meanwhile gathered support of more than [200 tools](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/). This inspires us to reach also new levels of popularity on our point of origin: mathematical modeling. 

The community is very active in these days, and I am happy to announce many events happening in the near future:

- Keynote speakers were announced for the [American Modelica Conference 2024](https://modelica.org/events/american2024/) this October. We are excited to hear from Swaminathan Gopalswamy, Director of the Connected Autonomous Safe Technologies (CAST) Lab and from Clas A. Jacobson who is Senior Fellow in Systems Engineering at Carrier. [Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2024-tickets-794519207337?aff=oddtdtcreator) is open and early bird tickets are available until August 10. 
- The [call for papers](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/call2024/) for the [Asian Modelica conference](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/) in South Korea is still open. Scientific contributions can be handed in until August 1. Industrial user presentations and tutorials can be proposed until September 1. 

In the second half of 2024, a number of Modelica related events are located in **Munich, Germany**:

- September 4 - 6: I will attend the [ASIM Symposium](https://www.asim-gi.org/asim2024) that addresses the German-speaking community for modeling and simulation. 
- September 9 - 10: The [ThermoSim 2024](https://ltx.de/thermosim/2024) addresses the challenges in modeling and simulating thermal systems.
- December 4-5: The [ASAM international Conference](https://aic.asam.net/main_frontend.php) is especially relevant with respect to FMI and related standards.

Last but certainly not least, we are now planning the 
[16th International Modelica Conference](https://modelica.org/news/2024-06-24-16th-modelica-conference-lucerne/):
- September 8-10, 2025, in Lucerne, Switzerland. Organized by the University of Lucerne and the Modelica Association.

This will be the first visit of our conference tour to Switzerland. The Swiss economy is very active, multifaceted and successful. Many smaller, highly specialized companies are now using system simulation more intensively than before and this conference will be a great opportunity for mutual exchange.

**Our community is also growing:** we are very glad to welcome two new organizational members to our association:

- [COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/) is member since March 13, 2024.
- [Beckhoff Automation](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/company/) is member since May 9th 2024. 

Further growth in advisory members is spurred by the FMI group and communicated in the corresponding FMI news. 

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities, please 
follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html). The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is WEEKDAY, MONTH DD, 2024.
