Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

I am writing to you as the newly elected chairperson of the Modelica Association. After 25 years of inspiring leadership, we could honor the enormous contribution that Prof. Martin Otter made to this association since its official foundation in the year 2000 with a [celebratory colloquium](https://modelica.org/news/2024-05-28-new-board-elected/) in Munich. His never-ending drive for new technologies and his incredible know-how in system dynamics ensured that both Modelica and FMI became standards of world-wide recoginition. Given this, I am even more happy that he remains on the board of the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association/) in his new role leading technology. 

I am very honored by the faith put in my person by the election of our members. It will be my highest duty to ensure that Modelica as standard for mathematical modeling becomes even better accessible and easier to learn. We can be proud on the enourmos success of the FMI-standard that meanwhile gathered support of more than [200 tools](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/). This inspires us to reach also new levels of popularity on our point of origin: mathematical modeling. 

The community is very active in these days, and I am happy to announce many events happening in the near future:

- Keynote speakers were announced for the [American Modelica Conference 2024](https://modelica.org/events/american2024/) this October. We are curious to hear from Swaminathan Gopalswamy, Director of the Connected Autonomous Safe Technologies (CAST) Lab and from Clas A. Jacobson  who is Senior Fellow in Systems Engineering at Carrier. [Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2024-tickets-794519207337?aff=oddtdtcreator) is open and early bird tickets are available until August 10. 
- The [call for papers papers](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/call2024/) for the [Asian Modelica conference](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/) in South Korea is still open. Scientific contributions can be handed in until August 1. Industrial user presentations and tutorials can be proposed until September 1. 

In the second half of 2024, a number of Modelica related events are located in **Munich, Gemany**:

- September 4 - 6: I will attend the [ASIM Symposium](https://www.asim-gi.org/asim2024) for the German-speaking part of the modeling and simulation community. 
- September 9 - 10: The [ThermoSim 2024](https://ltx.de/thermosim/2024) addresses the challenges in modeling and simulating thermal systems.
- December 4-5: The [ASAM international Conference](https://aic.asam.net/main_frontend.php) is especially relevant with respect to FMI and related standards.

Last but certainly not least, we are now planning the 
[16th International Modelica Conference](https://modelica.org/news/2024-06-24-16th-modelica-conference-lucerne/):
- September 8-10, 2025, in Lucernce, Switzerland. Organized by the University of Lucerne and the Modelica Association.

This will be the first visit of our conference tour to Switzerland. The Swiss economy is very active, multifaceted and succesful. Many smaller, highly specialized companies are now using system simulation more intensively than before and it will be a great opportunity for mutual exchange.

**Our community is also growing:**  we are very glad to welome two new organizational members to our association:

- [Beckhoff Automation](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/company/) is member since May 9th 2024. 
- [COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/) is member sinc March 13 2024.

Further growth is spurred by the FMI group and communicated in the corresponding FMI news.

Release of the news bylaws

At the last Modelica Association Assembly Meeting on Feb. 27, several [changes of the MA Bylaws](https://github.com/modelica/MA-Bylaws/pull/28) have been accepted by a majority of the votes. These changes take effect, if the second, required voting at the MA annual assembly meeting on May 28 will also be positive. The changes include adaptations due to legal requirements, clarification of voting of organizational members, fully adaptation of electronic meetings with increased flexibility of assembly meetings and other simplifications.
