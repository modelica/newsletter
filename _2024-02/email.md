Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

I am writing to you as the newly elected chairperson of the Modelica Association. After 25 years of inspiring leadership, we could honor the enormous contribution that Prof. Martin Otter made to this association *[(...)](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2024-02/index#letter-from-the-board)*.

The community is very active in these days, and I am happy to announce many events happening in the near future:

- Keynote speakers were announced for the [American Modelica Conference 2024](https://modelica.org/events/american2024/) this October. We are excited to hear from Swaminathan Gopalswamy, Director of the Connected Autonomous Safe Technologies (CAST) Lab and from Clas A. Jacobson who is Senior Fellow in Systems Engineering at Carrier.
