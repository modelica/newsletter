#### FMI Tools List, Compatibility Information, growing FMI 3.0 support

![FMI tools page](FMI_tools_page.png)

The [FMI tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) now lists 211 tools supporting tools!

The tools listed on top and marked with the golden star now provide "compatibility information": 
They document how the tool vendors have tested their FMU import and export capabilities and standard compliance with other tools. 
Exporting tools also provide example FMUs, that can be tested by other importing tools.
This information is provided on an external webpage or repository in the responsibility of the tool vendors.

We see an acceleration in the adoption of FMI 3.0, with 41 tools already supporting it.
