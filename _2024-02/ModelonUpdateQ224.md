### New and Updated Features in Modelon Impact

We’ve been hard at work making significant enhancements to Modelon Impact. Here are a few of the product highlights from the recent [2024.2 release.](https://modelon.com/blog/2024-2-release/)

#### Analysis View

We now have a dedicated space for data visualization in Modelon Impact. While users can still configure graphs in the model view, they can now configure multiple plots and graphs simultaneously for comparative analysis. 

Analysis View includes a histogram chart, stacked chart options, and the existing line graph and scatter plot options. All four chart options support dynamic and steady-state simulations. 

Users can also view the results for a single simulation or a customizable set of multiple simulations. This helps users zero in on the desired results, even when performing batch simulations.

#### Experiment Setup

Multi-run simulations in Modelon Impact just got more powerful. Users can now easily set up multiple simulations with parameter sweeps, making comparing configurations such as controller types and initialization options easier. 

Users can also execute a Design of Experiments by specifying the number of cases they want to run and the distribution parameters.

#### Native Calibration Workflow

We’ve now built an out-of-the-box custom workflow for calibrating a model against a dataset. This calibration workflow package includes calibration examples and a customizable web application for data visualization. 

We’ve also made significant additions to our libraries regarding Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft Applications, Improved Thermal Management Modeling, and Energy Systems Optimization.

### New Case Study

#### MAN Energy Solutions: Creating a Virtual Test Bed for Next-Gen Industrial Heat Pumps

MAN ES has been researching and developing large-scale industrial heat pumps, which are vital for creating sustainable heating solutions for industries and municipalities. 

Dynamic models for transient simulation are integral to their design, validation, and commissioning process. When searching for a platform and partner to dynamically simulate their CO2 heat pump, they chose Modelon.

### Event Recap

#### Modelon Innovate 2024

Modelon Innovate 2024 took place on October 10-11th in Copenhagen. The two-day event brought together over one hundred system modeling and simulation experts from fifteen countries. The event featured insightful presentations on system simulation and hands-on workshops to enhance attendees’ skills in developing innovative physical systems in commercial industries.
