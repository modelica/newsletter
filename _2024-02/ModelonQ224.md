#### News and Updates from Modelon
In Q2, we released a new library, published a comprehensive eBook, and continued preparing for our international system modeling and simulation conference in October.

#### New: Energy Systems Library
![](Modelon-ESL-Banner-338-190.png)

Energy Systems Library (ESL) is designed to plan and optimize industrial to utility-scale energy systems (electricity/heat/hydrogen). The variety of pre-configured models, detailed customization capabilities, and interface to set boundary conditions enable holistic system analyses for energy system engineers working on decarbonization and green energy. ESL allows users to perform techno-economic optimizations, including the production, storage, and consumption (purchase and sale) of electricity, heat, water, CO2, hydrogen, and other fuels.

#### New eBook: In-House vs. Commercial System Simulation Tools 
Many engineers believe in-house system simulation tools are the most accurate and cost-effective for physical system design and simulation. Is that really the case? Our new eBook explores the benefits and trade-offs of in-house and commercial system simulation tools.
