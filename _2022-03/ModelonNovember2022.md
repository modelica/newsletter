### You're Invited to the Asian Modelica Conference! 

[<img src= "Modelon_Asian-Modelica-Conference_1200_627_v3.jpg" alt= "Asian Modelica Conference" width="600px">](https://2022.asian.conference.modelica.org/)

Modelica Conferences are events for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to all of the system simulation standards developed and maintained by the Modelica Association, in particular Modelica, the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI), the System Structure and Parameterization (SSP) standard and the The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP) standard and the Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems (eFMI) standard. The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications.

This year's Asian Modelica Conference is held on November 24-25th and will be a hybrid event, with in-person attendance in Tokyo, Japan. The organizers of this event include the Modelica Association, Sofia University, and Modelon K.K. To register for this event for online or in-person attendance, please visit the [conference page.](https://2022.asian.conference.modelica.org/)

### Modelon Case Studies

#### Lightyear and Modelon: Fast-Tracking All-Electric Solar Driving With System Simulation 

[<img src= "Modelon_Lightyear_1200_627_new_v1_2.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Lightyear Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/lightyear-solar-vehicle-system-simulation/)

Time is valuable, especially for a company such as Lightyear to build and bring to market a cutting-edge solar-electric vehicle. With Modelon Impact, Lightyear reduced its overall system design and simulation time while making smarter development decisions along the way.

#### Siemens Energy and Modelon: Adapting to the Future of Energy Technology with System Simulation 

[<img src= "Modelon_Siemens_Quote_1200_627_v1.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Siemens Energy Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/heat-pump-technology-adapting-to-the-future-with-system-simulation/)

Siemens Energy needed to improve and further develop its heat pumps to ensure the performance and design of the integrated systems worked efficiently before moving forward with deployment. 
In our new case study, learn how Siemens Energy integrated its advanced energy systems with its existing heat pump technology using Modelon Impact. [Read the case study.](https://modelon.com/support/heat-pump-technology-adapting-to-the-future-with-system-simulation/) 

#### Saab and Modelon: Modernizing Fighter Aircraft with Open-Standard Technology 

[<img src= "Modelon_Saab_1200_627_v6_1.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Saab Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/modernizing-fighter-aircraft-with-open-standard-technology/))

In 1988, Saab made history with the Gripen - the first multirole fighter aircraft developed in Sweden to take flight. Since its initial development, Saab has been tasked with making iterations of the Gripen, which are each more powerful and technologically advanced than before. 
 
This case study explains how Saab worked with Modelon to incorporate MBSE and greatly enhance the Gripen without overextending its in-house resources. [Read the case study.](https://modelon.com/support/modernizing-fighter-aircraft-with-open-standard-technology/)
