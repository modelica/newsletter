### Modelon Case Studies

#### Lightyear and Modelon: Fast-Tracking All-Electric Solar Driving With System Simulation 

[<img src= "Modelon_Lightyear_1200_627_new_v1_2.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Lightyear Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/lightyear-solar-vehicle-system-simulation/)

Time is valuable, especially for a company such as Lightyear to build and bring to market a cutting-edge solar-electric vehicle. With Modelon Impact, Lightyear reduced its overall system design and simulation time while making smarter development decisions along the way.

#### Siemens Energy and Modelon: Adapting to the Future of Energy Technology with System Simulation 

[<img src= "Modelon_Siemens_Quote_1200_627_v1.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Siemens Energy Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/heat-pump-technology-adapting-to-the-future-with-system-simulation/)

Siemens Energy needed to improve and further develop its heat pumps to ensure the performance and design of the integrated systems worked efficiently before moving forward with deployment. 
In our new case study, learn how Siemens Energy integrated its advanced energy systems with its existing heat pump technology using Modelon Impact. [Read the case study.](https://modelon.com/support/heat-pump-technology-adapting-to-the-future-with-system-simulation/) 

#### Saab and Modelon: Modernizing Fighter Aircraft with Open-Standard Technology 

[<img src= "Modelon_Saab_1200_627_v6_1.jpg" alt= "Modelon and Saab Case Study" width="600px">](https://modelon.com/support/heat-pump-technology-adapting-to-the-future-with-system-simulation/)

In 1988, Saab made history with the Gripen - the first multirole fighter aircraft developed in Sweden to take flight. Since its initial development, Saab has been tasked with making iterations of the Gripen, which are each more powerful and technologically advanced than before. 
 
This case study explains how Saab worked with Modelon to incorporate MBSE and greatly enhance the Gripen without overextending its in-house resources. [Read the case study.](https://modelon.com/support/modernizing-fighter-aircraft-with-open-standard-technology/)
