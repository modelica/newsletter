The **[15th International Modelica Conference 2023](https://2023.international.conference.modelica.org/)** will be back **in person** \
**Aachen, Germany, Mo. Oct. 9 - Wed. Oct. 11, 2023**, so as a **face-to-face conference**.

It is organized by Prof. Dirk MÃ¼ller and his team from [RWTH Aachen University / Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1),\
in cooperation with the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/).

We are excited to have the Modelica Association community back together in an International Modelica Conference since 2019 and have the opportunity to talk in person to each other. The conference will bring together people using [Modelica Association standards](https://modelica.org/) (Modelica language, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI), as well as standard developers/designers, tool vendors, library developers and other interested people. You will have the opportunity to stay informed about the latest standards-, libraries-, and tools-enhancements, and to get in touch with people working on similar challenges as you are doing. As in the past, the conference will be accompanied by tutorials, vendor presentations and an exhibition.

More information will be soon provided on the [conference web page](https://2023.international.conference.modelica.org/), especially, the Call-for-Papers.
