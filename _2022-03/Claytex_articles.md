#### Basic Dymola Terminology

Like anything technical, there’s plenty of jargon surrounding Dymola and its functionality. While much of it is relatively self-explanatory, some may not be clear at first glance. In this blog post we try to shed some light on basic Dymola terminology, and provide a few details on their application in the world of Dymola.

Packed with various gizmos and technologies, we thought it would be a fun exercise in simple multibody modelling to build some of the famous features of these machines.
