Learn and teach mechanics courses using the labs from the College Mechanical Engineering library. Simulate things such as a stunt jump, camera stabilization system, and washing machine to understand mechanical engineering concepts, including coordinate transformation, kinematics, and dynamics. You will also learn to create and test models with 3D animations.
