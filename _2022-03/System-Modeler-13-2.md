The upcoming version of System Modeler contains many new features. Some of the significant features are:
- *Interactively Explore Simulation Results*: Explore model behavior interactively using sliders, popup menus, and checkboxes.
- *Helpful & Precise Model Validation*: Precisely detect errors using improved error messages and warnings that link directly to the relevant line of code.
- *Quantify System Performance*: Automatically measure the performance and quality of a system with properties such as rise time, settling time, overshoot, and more.
- *Free Aircraft Library*: Decrease design for new aircraft using novel weight estimation method. Use ready-made digital twins of existing conventional aircraft or create your own by parametrization.
- *Free Rotating Machinery Library*: Model and analyze rotating machinery systems, such as turbines, motors, and drivelines. Easily create digital twins of roller bearings from SKF, Timken, Koyo, and more, and analyze deformations and contact pressures.
