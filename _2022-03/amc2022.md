The American Modelica Conference 2022 was held in Richardson, Texas in October.
This was our first in-person event since COVID and from all appearances,
attendees thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to get together and discuss their
work with Modelica. There were around 60 attendees for this year's event
presenting on a wide range of topics.

### Keynotes

This year's keynote talks were given by Dr. Dirk Zimmer from DLR and
Dr. Scott Bortoff from MERL. Special thanks to Scott Bortoff for filling in at
the last minute!

### Special Thanks

Special thanks to this year's Platinum Sponsor, Ricardo Software (now Realis
Simulation) as well as to our Gold Sponsors, Dassault Systèmes, Modelon,
JuliaHub, Wolfram, Ansys and our Silver Sponsor, Maplesoft.

We'd also like to thank Professor Yaoyu Li (University of Texas at Dallas) for
all his hard work in providing us with an excellent venue for this year's event
and his students for helping with the execution of the event.
