The OpenModelica 1.15.0 Beta1 release has been made available for testing. The main enhancement in this release is the graphical user interface support of replaceable items in libraries. The speed of the OMEdit GUI has also increased in this release. 

This release is also using a further improved version of the OpenModelica Compiler New Frontend (NF), which on the average gives a factor of 10-20 speed improvement in the flattening phase of compilation compared to the old frontend.
