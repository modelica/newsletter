DaVE is a visualization and simulation environment that is suitable for both the post-processing and the online display of dynamic data. The current **version 2.0** includes new developments and improvements, of which a small selection shall be mentioned here:
 - Easy exchange of configurations: The "Pack Configuration" command creates a zip file that contains the configuration and the data files used. This ensures that all files are available when the configuration is exchanged. This also simplifies the backup of data.
 - Executing mathematical operations: The new Data Connector "Calculation" offers the possibility to do simple mathematical operations (e.g. sum, differences, average values etc.). The results are then available as additional variables and can be used in the instruments.
 - Extended StateChart instrument: The instrument "StateChart" has been extended by various functionalities. In addition to automatic isoline labeling, the "Multi-Edit" function has significantly reduced the time needed to configure point labels. Furthermore, a search filter for VLE media has been implemented and the selection of a standard medium has been added. In addition, various options for the visual enhancement of the instrument were implemented.
