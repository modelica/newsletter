The [14th International Modelica Conference](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/) was a remote and free event this year. It was broadcast from the Concert and Congress hall in **Linköping, Sweden, September 20-24, 2021**. 
It has been organized by [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) and [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en), in cooperation with the Modelica Association.

**The conference** opening was live-streamed from Linköping Concert and Congress hall, where the event was originally planned to be held.

## Welcome

We would have loved to welcome you in Linköping at the Concert and Congress hall, but unfortunately even after delaying the conference by 6 months, we have made the decision to move the conference online due to the pandemic. We decided to turn this into an opportunity,  by waiving registration fees so that more people would have the possibility to get involved in the community. We are grateful to our sponsors and the Modelica Association for making this possible. Another change we have made this year is to extend the conference over the whole week, and we dedicated half of each day to scientific papers and half to tutorials, vendor sessions and industrial user sessions.  Two half-days were dedicated to Industrial User Presentation Sessions, that are not part of the proceedings, but an opportunity for actual users to exchange their experience with the community.  This year we received a total of 81 submissions, all throughly reviewed by our program committee.
