The free Business Simulation Library (BSL) supports modeling & simulation of dynamical systems in the social sciences, e.g., business, economics, and ecology using the System Dynamics metaphor. Unlike the well-known System Dynamics library, the BSL makes use of *acausal* connectors so that multiple flows will automatically add up when connected to a stock. Also, mass balance requirements will not be violated when making connections across subsystems in a model. The *potential* variable within an acausal connection is used to transmit the amount contained in a connected stock making diagrams less cluttered and modeling faster. See the *word of mouth* interaction between potential customers and customers in the model diagram below, which is an example that ships with the library.

The new release, while fixing some errors with regard to platform compatibility, mainly adds high-level classes for agile modeling of dynamical systems using an impact diagram like framework: Domain experts simply need to provide estimates for *polarity*, *strength*, and an (optional) *delay time* to specify the impact of one variable upon another, where the strength of impact is specified as a proportionality factor or an  elasticity coefficient (see the release notes [here](https://bsl-support.de/BusinessSimulation/BusinessSimulation.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes.Version_2_0_0.html)).

The library was developed using Wolfram System Modeler and can be downloaded from its library store [here](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/business-simulation/) or it can be downloaded from the developer's GitHub account [here](https://github.com/bslMS/BusinessSimulation).
