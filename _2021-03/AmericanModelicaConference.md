We would like to announce the [American Modelica Conference 2022](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/), which will be a hybrid conference event and the first opportunity since the 2019 conference to meet your Modelica colleagues in person. The conference will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center from October 26–28, 2022. It is organized by NAMUG, the North American Modelica Users Group, in cooperation with the Modelica Association. Join us in person in Dallas or from the comfort of your own home, as the ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually will be provided for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors, and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica, FMI, SSP, eFMI and DCP. The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications.

In addition to paper presentations, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as industrial user presentations, vendor sessions, and an exhibition. The previous American Modelica conference in 2020 was fully online and saw a record number of registrations compared to in-person events, so this time we want to combine the ease of attendance by remote participants from other continents with the fun of a real, in person event with lively discussions in the breaks and an in-person conference dinner!

This conference will have one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, as well as a track of industrial user-oriented presentations do not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts of the presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board. Please see the [Call for Papers](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/call2022.html) for details about paper submissions, as well as the calls for industrial user presentations, tutorials, and vendor presentations. The submission deadlines are as follows:

- May 1, 2022: Submission of full papers for reviewed papers
- June 1, 2022: Submission of extended abstracts for presentation-only contributions and tutorials
- August 1, 2022: Notification of acceptance for papers and presentations
- September 1st, 2022: Submission of final papers and one-page abstracts
- September 5th, 2022: Submission of final presentations

We are looking forward to seeing you in Dallas, TX.

Dr. Michael Tiller, Dr. Hubertus Tummescheit, Associate Professor Luigi Vanfretti, PhD, and Dr. Michael Wetter
