#### Maintenance release FMI 2.0.3

The FMI project has published a maintenance release FMI 2.0.3 with bugfixes and clarifications, see [here](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.3)

#### FMI 3.0

The FMI 3.0 standard is in beta.2 stage and we are close to a release candidate RC1. The FMI 3.0 development can be followed [on Gibthub](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard).
We encourage tool vendors to increase their implementation effort for FMI 3.0, to provide final feedback and participate in the FMI3.0 PlugFests organized by the FMI Project.
