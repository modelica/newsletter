#### Maintenance release FMI 2.0.3

The FMI project has published a maintenance release FMI 2.0.3 with bugfixes and clarifications, see [here](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.3)

#### FMI 3.0

The FMI 3.0 standard is in beta.2 stage and we are close to a release candidate RC1. The FMI 3.0 development can be followed [on Github](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard).
We encourage tool vendors to increase their implementation effort for FMI 3.0 prototypes to provide final feedback and to contribute to test cases which are required for the release. Participation in FMI 3.0 PlugFests is highly recommended. The next one is planned for January 25th 2022.
