#### About the Conference
As part of the conferences promoted by the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association/), the [American Modelica & FMI Conference 2026](https://modelica.org/events/american2026/) is the main event in North America for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to [Modelica](https://modelica.org/), [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org/), [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org/), [eFMI](http://efmi-standard.org/) and [DCP](https://dcp-standard.org/).
The program will cover processes and tools for the modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems as applied to a wide range of research and industrial applications.  For the 2026 conference, we will also include a new track on the structure and application of equation-oriented modeling languages other than Modelica into the program, since we see many similarities that will enrich a wider conversation centered on principles of equation-oriented modeling and encourage growth of our community.

In addition to paper presentations, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as industrial user presentations, vendor sessions, and an exhibition.  We hope to build on the success of the previous [2024 American Modelica conference](https://modelica.org/events/american2024/) by providing an venue for stimulating conversations among attendees of many different backgrounds, ranging from those who are exploring and learning about the language for the first time to long-standing experts, with lively discussions in the breaks and an in-person conference dinner!
