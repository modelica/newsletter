**Call for presentations/participation** for the OpenModelica workshop and the MODPROD workshop on model-based cyber-physical product development. The OpenModelica workshop is concerned with tooling and applications of OpenModelica,
whereas the MODPROD workshop covers general cyber-physical system modeling and system development using multiple tools and formalisms. Several tutorials will be given including topics such as Modelica, FMI, Modelica-in-Julia, etc.

The workshops are organized in cooperation with INCOSE Sweden and IEEE Computer Society Swedish Chapter.

Location: Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden
See https://modprod.github.io for latest updates.

"EconoLab: Teaching Model-Based Economic Dynamics with Modelica in a Computer Science Course"

**Keynotes for MODPROD2026 Workshop (preliminary):**

-  **Prof. Benoit Combemale**, INRIA.

"There Is Only One Time in Systems Engineering! Towards a Continuous (model-based) Engineering"

Benoit is research director of INRIA, full professor (University of Rennes, IRISA) with ‪‪research in software engineering and model-driven engineering software engineering, (MDE),
software language engineering (SLE) and software validation & verification (V&V), mostly in the context of smart cyber-physical systems and Internet of things.‬‬

-  **Prof. Ramin Karim**, Luleå University of Technology.

Ramin is professor of industrial AI & eMaintenance and founder of a spin-off company from Luleå University of Technology, which develops analytics solutions based on industrial AI and eMaintenance.

-  **Dr. Björn Nagel**, DLR/Linköping University.

"Collaborative Aircraft Design Engineering for Future Technologies"

Björn is the director of the Institute of System Architectures in Aeronautics at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). His research is focused on digital engineering methods including MBSE and MDO enabling large and heterogeneous teams to model and optimize aviation as a system-of-systems.
Pathways to climate-compatible air transport, co-design for industrialization and military air systems are his major fields of research.
