#### New initiative to teach progressively Modelica on LinkedIn

Since mid-September, [Clément Coïc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clementcoic/) launched a LinkedIn newsletter: [Learn Modelica & FMI](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/learn-modelica-fmi-7373084674463719424/).    
The idea is simple: we all have busy lives, so if one wants to learn new skills, it should be through **short**, **gradual**, **clear** and **regular** notes or videos that can be consumed during a daily break - like when drinking your morning cup of tea 🫖 or coffee ☕️.

Since then, a dozen of articles have been published explaining *Modeling and Simulation* best practices, as well as Modelica and FMI concepts, such as causality and acausality.

#### Also available on its own website

The LinkedIn newsletter has now also [its own website](https://dr-clementcoic.github.io/LearnModelicaFMI/)!    
This makes it easier to find all the content that has been posted and allows for slightly better text formatting.     
This website will also, in the near future, host the models developed for the newsletter.
Articles are still being posted on LinkedIn first, as it remains the best platform to spread the word and exchange ideas on the discussed topics.

Contributions are welcome!    
Just reach out to me.    
Clem
