Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

As an eventful year draws to a close, this Advent newsletter is the perfect opportunity to look back at our flagship event:

### Past and Future Events for Our Community

We are delighted to have received so much positive feedback about the [16th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) in Lucerne. The new format — with dedicated tracks for FMI and related standards as well as for industrial user presentations — proved very successful. Both tracks were well attended, giving the conference a noticeably different character: many participants told us that the event felt more methodologically oriented and encouraged them to engage in exchanges with attendees from different application domains who face similar challenges. This kind of dialogue is exactly what we aim for as a truly multi-domain community.

Our participants also showed remarkable enthusiasm and stamina. Discussions remained animated throughout the entire dinner boat cruise, the packed program triggered the occasional sprint from one lecture hall to the next, and yet most attendees stayed until the very end, with conversations continuing past the official program.

Selecting the awards was no easy task for the conference board: many excellent papers were submitted, and eight free libraries entered the competition. Please have a look at the [corresponding Modelica news item](https://modelica.org/news/2025-10-27-conferenceproceedingsandfreelibraries/). Many existing free libraries also received significant updates. The official [conference proceedings](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218) have been published as Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings (as well as the [proceedings of the Asian Modelica Conference 2024](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp217)). Many presentations can be found online via the [conference app](https://pretalx.com/16thmodelicafmiconference/schedule/). Selected recodings of the live presentations are currently being processed and will be published soon. 

Once again, I would like to thank our two outstanding [keynote speakers](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes) Mishra Siddhartha and Johan R Åkesson as well as all participants in the panel discussion. We are very grateful to have received support from our [sponsors](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#sponsors). Most of the credit, however, goes to our local organizer, Prof. Ulf Christian Müller, Ivo Steiner, and the entire team from [HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/en/). Organizing a conference of this scale is a tremendous effort, and the Modelica Association is truly grateful to have been able to hold its conference in such a marvellous location.

Of course, there is always room for improvement, and we will carry these lessons forward to our upcoming events:

- September 21-22, 2026: [Asian Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Hangzhou, China
- October 12-14, 2026: [American Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Atlanta, USA
- September 20-22, 2027: [17th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Prague, Czech Republic

The respective websites will go live very soon. Beyond these major conferences, please also note the many smaller workshops and events. I would particularly like to highlight for 2026:

- February 2-4: [OpenModelica/MODProd Workshop](https://modprod.github.io/cfp/) in Linköping, Sweden
- May 5, 2026: Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026, Cologne, Germany
- June 15, 2026: [EOOLT Workshop](https://eoolt.org/2026/index.html) on Equation-Based Languages in Bielefeld, Germany
- September 22-23, 2026: [ThermoSim 2026](https://tlk-energy.de/blog-en/thermosim-modeling-simulation-thermal-systems) in Aachen, Germany

…and this list is certainly incomplete. I also encourage you to watch for events from our partner organizations, such as [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/standards/). For me, it is truly wonderful to see so many activities that keep our community vibrant and thriving.

### On Modelica & FMI in China (II)

As noted in the previous newsletter, the user base for Modelica standards in China is very large and is supported by local tools and dedicated teaching material. However, the Modelica Association itself has so far been underrepresented there, which means that many Modelica- and FMI-related efforts within China remain somewhat fragmented. We shall also ensure that progress achieved in Asia flows back into the international standards so that the entire world can benefit.

To address this, the Modelica Association is proud to have gained [Dr. Rui Gao](https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/) (CTO of Nanjing Yuansi SimTek) as our new Secretary of the Board. He is currently focusing on the upcoming Asian Modelica Conference at Beihang University in Hangzhou. Dr. Gao has assembled a large organizing committee that includes tool vendors, industry representatives, academia, and members from Japan and Korea. His work will immediately help strengthen the Asian branch of our community.

Dr. Gao succeeds [Dr. Michael Tiller](https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/), who served on the board for more than 20 years. The Modelica Association is deeply grateful for his long service and pleased that he will continue as a regular member and in the board of [NAMUG](https://namug.org/).

### Teaching Initiative

In Lucerne, I briefly announced that the Modelica Association intends to launch a Teaching Initiative. The response was immediate and very encouraging.  Clément Coïc has taken the lead and has already started publishing an insightful series of [introductory articles on social media](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7373084674463719424/). If you are not active on social media, do not worry since the articles will also be made available in a more traditional format.

Alberto Leva raised a very valuable point by preparing content specifically for the control-engineering community, and several experienced lecturers have pointed us to their existing teaching material. The next steps for the Modelica Association will therefore be to make this material more easily accessible and to provide guidance in a form that allows interested learners (of any age and background) to quickly find the resources most relevant to them.

The teaching initiative is still in its early stages. One of its goals is also to give teachers and professors a stronger voice within our association. If you have good material you would like to share or ideas of your own, please feel free to contact me or Clément.

I wish you all a Merry Christmas, a joyful holiday season, and a great start to 2026
