* **Component (v1.0):** This Modelica-powered cloud editor now features comprehensive **Version Control** (snapshots, history, and code comparison) and robust **Modelica Package** support (including .zip imports with resources). New capabilities also allow direct CSV/custom table imports for cloud-compatible data injection.

* **System (v1.0):** The System app now fully supports **SSP** (System Structure and Parameterization). A redesigned interface enables drag-and-drop FMU assembly and visual parameter management for complex architectures.
* **Architecture (Beta):** This tool bridges the gap between architectural design and behavioral simulation by synchronizing SysML models from SysOn directly into ODE Assets.

1. **[Transfer](https://www.orthogonal.dev/ode-transfer)****&#x20;(Model Collaboration):** A new standalone platform for sharing FMU and SSP models. Users can generate links to transform simulations into interactive, browser-based experiences without requiring viewer installation or user sign-ups.
