In many fields, Modelica has become a proven and widely used modeling technology. For thermal and energy systems, it is already a major success. In process engineering, however, its use is still limited to isolated activities, despite strong technical foundations and no inherent barriers to broader adoption.

Over the years, several promising efforts appeared — academic prototypes, industrial pilots, small working groups. But they rarely connected with each other, and many initiatives faded before a real community could form. At the same time, established tools such as Aspen and gPROMS continue to dominate the PSE landscape.

At TLK Energy, we work with these challenges directly. With the Process Systems Library (PSL), we see how much potential Modelica has in this domain. But we are also convinced that progress will only happen if those working on similar ideas finally find each other. A stronger network is needed — not only for discussion, but for concrete collaborations and projects.

To help spark this connection, we are initiating the **Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026**.

**Date:** May 5, 2026  
**Location:** ANNO 1858, Cologne, Germany

**Format:**
- Short impulse talks and application reports  
- Open discussion rounds and exchange of experiences  
- Show & Tell contributions from participants  
- Informal networking from 17:00  
- Joint dinner in the *Brauerei Malzmühle* from 18:00

The event website will go online soon. To receive an update once registration opens, please sign up for the [TLK Energy newsletter](https://tlk-energy.de/en/newsletter).

We look forward to connecting the community and meeting many of you in Cologne.
