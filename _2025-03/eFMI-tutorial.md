The recording and slides of the eFMI® Tutorial presented at the [16th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) (8th of September 2025) are now public available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/HobYT2BYTL0) (videos) and the [eFMI website](https://www.efmi-standard.org/) (slides & videos).

We had about 15 participants from 13 organizations and the feedback has been great! Close to all participants managed to follow the hands-on, for which we provided a portable Dymola & CATIA Software Production Engineering with all required tooling like compilers, libraries etc included. Many of the participants got really excited and used the unique opportunity provided by the conference to discuss the feasability of eFMI in their application domain.

**We like to thank each participant for joining the tutorial and your kind feedback!**

The tutorial demonstrates the current state-of-the-art of available eFMI tooling in five individual parts, including an eFMI overview, motivating example, hands-on, advanced examples and industry use-case. The respective YouTube recordings are:
 - [Part 1: eFMI® motivation and overview](https://youtu.be/HobYT2BYTL0)
 - [Part 2: Running use-case introduction](https://youtu.be/Cng653GW7f4)
 - [Part 3: Hands-on in Dymola and Software Production Engineering](https://youtu.be/K-21h-C1MxM)
 - [Part 4: Advanced demonstrators](https://youtu.be/nkugRv_cwnA)
 - [Part 5 (industry case-study): eFMI based thermal management system (TMS) development for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV)](https://youtu.be/aJlEDmVOuVQ)

Highlights of the tutorial are Part 4, the advanced examples including the new [eFMI.NeuralNetworks Modelica library](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases) and the battery management system (BMS) demonstrator presented at the DS booth ([BMS technical report](https://www.efmi-standard.org/media/resources/eFMI-Tutorial-2025-Part-4-BMS-demo.pdf)), and Part 5, the first application of eFMI in industrial production for the thermal management of the fuel cells of an electric vehicle by iVH ([presentation slides](https://www.efmi-standard.org/media/resources/eFMI-Tutorial-2025-Part-5.pdf)). Both parts show the steady progress of eFMI tooling and how we can achieve high-hanging fruits with the tooling we already have right now.

If you have any general questions or feedback on what you think we need to improve or also cover in such tutorial, please contact us on our _public_ mailing list, [`efmi-info@googlegroups.com`](https://groups.google.com/g/efmi-info) (no Google account required) or write a _private_ mail to `Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com`.

**Your feedback is very welcome!**
