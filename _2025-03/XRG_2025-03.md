#### 16th Int. Modelica & FMI Conference Review 

We have enjoyed a great community event in the [**16th International Modelica & FMI conference**](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) at Lucerne in September. Thank you for so many interesting discussions and shared ideas at our booth!

The conference started with a well-attended [**Workshop on SMArtInt+ (Link to Youtube video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn6QDx01uzU) to learn how to integrate and generate AI surrogates from within Dymola. 

For the first time we saw a session solely dedicated to Modelica in "Maritime Applications". Check our [**paper**](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218801) on "Modelica driven development of the thermal management control system for a zero-emission yacht". It demonstrates how the exported FMU of the thermal energy system modelled with **HVAC Library** can be used to design the control logics outside of the Modelica tool (software in the loop simulation). 

In our talk about "Status of the SMArtInt Library" ([**link to paper**](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218459)) we showcased a Modelica realization of the Balanced Neural ODE (BNODE) architecture applied to a ClaRa power plant example, demonstrating the potential of this generic AI-driven non-linear model reduction technique.   

Finally, our open-source library [**SMArtInt**](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtInt) received the Modelica Library Award (3rd prize) at Lucerne. This encourages us to continue our development towards an open interface for simple generation of Modelica hybrid models that combine the clarity of physics encoded in model equations with the accuracy of real data encoded in AI.

#### Modelica Library Announcements

**HumanComfort Library 2.20.0** provides a new 3D soil model for building simulations to represent realistic underground conditions with multiple soil layers. It is a helpful model for the simulation of a variety of foundation types, including semi-basements, making it suitable for more complex building foundation designs. The soil domain can be discretized to capture spatial temperature gradients with a suitable level of detail. Several common soil types are included with physical properties like heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and density, so you can start simulations quickly. Users can also add or adjust soil properties to match specific project requirements. This provides a reliable model for simulating soil-structure interactions in real-world building simulation projects.

**HVAC Library 3.5.0** for HVAC system simulation introduces powerful new capabilities:

 - A comprehensive **Data Center Cooling Simulation Model** and sub-modules has been added, showcasing an example of a full-year simulation under **hot Abu Dhabi climate conditions**. The climate conditions can easily be changed by using other Energy+ weather data files.
 The system features a **three-stage cooling architecture** with water- and air-cooled components, hybrid recoolers with **free-cooling mode**, CRAH/CDU branches, and chilled-water supply for a 1 MW IT load. 
 The model is suited to perform energy performance studies and comparison of control strategies, evaluation of free-cooling potential, and location-based design optimization — offering a strong reference for real-world data center applications.
 - A new **stepwise controller model** with timing and error-handling logic has been added which can be used to control heat pump models.

**ClaRa+ Library 1.8.0 for energy system simulation introduces powerful new capabilities for modeling liquid systems:**

 - This release adds a set of new liquid components, including pumps, heat exchangers, a balance tank, and junction and splitter models. These components extend the library’s capability to cover a wider range of liquid-based processes.

 - Liquid components now feature a **scalar-quantity stream variable array**, allowing users to transport arbitrary scalar quantities throughout a liquid network. Within liquid volume components, users can formulate **custom source and sink equations** for these scalar quantities. This makes it possible to model phenomena such as delayed neutron precursors, decay-heat precursors, corrosion products, fission products, or any other user-defined tracers with full flexibility.

Together, these enhancements broaden the scope of ClaRa+, enabling advanced liquid transient simulations for research and industrial applications.

**SMArtIntPlus 2.0.0** introduces two major new capabilities for integration and training of artificial intelligence in Modelica:

 - **Data Generator**: This new feature allows you to create training and validation datasets directly from Modelica models. Input values are efficiently sampled using **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**, covering the desired parameter space. The generator can operate in different modes, supporting both steady-state and dynamic applications.

 - **Network Generator**: Define, train, and export neural networks directly within Modelica. The generator integrates a compiled Python backend with TensorFlow support, enabling the creation of custom network architectures and their export as TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite models. It also supports **Dimensionless AI** via the **Dedimensionalization-Layer**. The Network Generator makes it easy to create **hybrid models** that combine Neural Networks with physical equations.

#### New partners

**ODE Supersystems** has integrated our **HVAC Library** into the [**Orthogonal Component App**](https://plus.orthogonal.dev/component). It is available for simulation and modelling of HVAC systems in buildings. **You can test 7 days for free!**

#### Research

XRG has continued its commitment to sustainability and open-source software as an active member of the TransiEnt library consortium, reflected in the [**paper**]( https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218989) of the 16th Int. Modelica and FMI Conference.  

Our development towards hybrid modelling continues in the ITEA4 research project [**OpenSCALING**](https://openscaling.org/) which we joint in April 2025. Stay tuned!
