#### News from the FMI Project

The FMI Project actively maintains the FMI 2.0.x and 3.0.x standards, and currently focusses on the development of Layered Standards to extend FMI for new application domains:

* [FMI-LS-XCP](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp) v1.0.0 released in Dec 2024: This layered standard defines support for [XCP](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-1-xcp/) or “Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol”, a network protocol defined by [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/). 
* [FMI-LS-BUS](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus) v1.0.0 just released, see below. This layered standard defines how to realize the simulation of network communication with FMI 3.0 means.
* [FMI-LS-STRUCT](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct) v1.0.0-alpha.1 prerelease: Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the “structured naming convention” of the FMI Standard. The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.
* [FMI-LS-REF](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-ref) (in development). It will allow for the inclusion of related files into an FMU. This includes parameter sets, reference stimuli and results, which can be used in additional experiments, as well as other relevant files to the FMU, like the model sources, requirements, or specifications.

Additionally two new working groups for the improvement of efficiency of data communication between FMUs and for DAE support have been formed.
